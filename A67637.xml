            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But when on the other ſide I remember how deafe wee have beene unto all thoſe Orators, it might well be conceived a thing hopeleſſe for me to be heard, where ſo many and ſo earneſt pleaders from heaven have not obtained an hearing.</p>
            <p>Not a ſtroke that God hath laid upon us, but hath brought with it an admonition unto hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and Prayer.</p>
            <p>The Word of God, and the rod of God are but ſeveral prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in a divers dialect of one and the ſame doctrin. The word ſpeakes it more clearely: The Rod more terribly: The Word is the interpreter of the Rod
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43922:19"/>and the Rod the quickner and enforcer of the Word: In the WOrd God dictates his Rules and Precepts, and calamities are as it were the Preſſe of the Almighty to imprint them upon the Tables of our hearts. Affliction urgeth us to every duty, but to none more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly then to humiliation and prayer.</p>
            <p>The Rhetorique thereof hath been ſo powerfull, that it hath convinced Hypocrites, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven meere naturall men. It was ſo powerfull that it brought downe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> to do ſomething in humiliation. Though they came ſhort of the full performance; it forced ſome expreſſions even from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43922:20"/>corruption it ſelf, it overcame the ſtubborneſſe of rebellious Iſrael, although their hearts were not right toward God; yet whilſt the hand of the Lord was upon them in the multiplied laſhes of the divine indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt ſin, they durſt not ſtand out in a profeſſed oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but fell downe proſtrate at the incenſed divinity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34. <hi>When he ſlew them, them they ſought him, and they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and enquired early after God, and they remembred that God was their Rocke, and the high God their Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was prevalent upon the naturall temper, (for we know no other that bee had) of the Shipmaſter in <hi>Ionah,</hi> ſo that he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43922:20"/>could become the reprover of <hi>Ionah</hi> for his ſluggiſhneſſe, and exhort him to the neceſſary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſupplication to the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Ionah</hi> 1.6. when the ſtorme was violent upon them, hee thought it ſtrange that <hi>Ionah</hi> ſhould be aſleep and forget to pray.

            <p>It is a Doctrine that nature it ſelf it ſeemes can heare from the mouth of preſent diſtreſſe and anguiſh; a voice of God that overcommeth the deaſeneſſe of thoſe that are ſpiritually dead: A principle much below Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, that was legible in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43922:21"/>dark and gloomy glimmerings of corrupt humanity: That it concernes men to ſeek for help of God in the time of danger, and anxiety. Yea ſome have thought that it hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible enough, to improve the bruitiſhneſſe of meere ſenſible creatures, and to teach them ſome motions toward God and heaven in their extreame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities; <hi>The Lions roaring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their prey ſeeke their meate of God;</hi> who <hi>prepareth for the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his food, when his yong ones cry unto God? Iob</hi> 38 41.</p>
            <p>And although that of <hi>Lori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> be good Commentary, that it ſignifies, that God is invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by them, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not by the clamour of language
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43922:21"/>but by the cry of their neceſſity, which God is pleaſed to heare by the holy eare of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſo farre as to extend his care herein unto thoſe bruitiſh Creatures; Or that of <hi>Simeon de Muis</hi> upon the 104. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> That theſe bruitiſh Creatures are ſaid to ſeeke their food of God, whoſe office it is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for all, in the like ſence, wherein we may ſay, that the child by his cry asketh food, or the Teat of the mother, which yet knoweth not the mother.</p>
            <p>Yet I find <hi>Euthymius</hi> brought in for the Author, that many men have often ſeene it in the time of famine or drought, that thoſe brutes have lift up their eyes unto heaven, as if they did
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43922:22"/>by an ineffable kind of language call upon their Creatour for a ſupply.</p>
            <p>And is it not a ſhame that wee ſhould bee ſuch dunces in Piety, that we ſhould be of a lower forme therein than the beaſts themſelves? that wee ſhould be ſet to learne to ſeeke God in affliction of the Ravens and the Lions, and yet come ſhort of the leſſon?</p>
            <p>It was an ignominious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that lay upon the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Iſrael, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 1.3. That the Oxe knew his owner and the Aſſe his Maſters Crib: And yet Iſrael did not know nor conſider the bounty of God who was ſo liberall a Maſter toward them; at whoſe hand
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43922:22"/>they were continually fed, at the breaſts of whoſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they continually ſucked: who bare them in the armes of his mercy, and carried them in the boſome of his compaſſion.</p>
            <p>The Wiſeman without doubt intendeth to ſhame (as well as to inſtruct) the ſluggard when he ſets that Truant to Schoole unto the Piſmire, that he may learne induſtry and providence of that little Miſtris.</p>
            <p>And certainly <hi>Iob</hi> meant it for no grace unto the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers he was inſtructing, when he ſends them for learning in matter of providence to the Beaſts and Foules, to the Earth and to the fiſhes: And what a diſhonourable ſtupidity is it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43922:23"/>in us; that Affliction ſhould in any ſenſe worke that upon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall men, upon meere hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, yea upon bruit crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that theſe ſhould in any ſignification be ſaid to ſeeke to God in the time of affliction; And that we cannot learne this leſſon of the ſame Maſter. It is time for us to diſclaimeour very humanity and kind, and to yeild up all the preheminence thereof unto the meaneſt of thoſe creatures, if wee ſuffer them to outgoe us in Religion too, as well as they are beyond us in many other perfections.</p>
            <p>And yet alas how dull have we approved our ſelves! How many ſevere Maſters hath God ſet over us for the purpoſe; To
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43922:23"/>teach us theſe ſo low and mean Lectures of Piety: To ſeeke for deliverance from God in the time of our trouble, at leaſt when the cauſe is ſo with us, that we can ſee no hope of attaining it any where elſe; that we ſhould at leaſt make God our <hi>Cum nemini</hi> as it is ſaid, and betake our ſelves to him when all other helpers reject us; that wee ſhould make him our laſt refuge, if we will not make him our choiſe; and yet how poore proficients have we proved our ſelves herein? Are wee ſuch ſworne fooles that experience can teach us nothing after ſo long a Prentiſhip of miſery? Are we ſo faſt aſleep that no Thunder can awake us? So
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43922:24"/>dead in our <hi>Lethargy,</hi> that wee cannot feele ſo many bloudy gaſhes that the Sword of the Lord hath made upon the wounded and dying body of our Nation? that we have no ſenſe of the ſcorching and the ſcalding of thoſe flames of the wrath of heaven, which have ſo waſted and conſumed us, and burnt away ſo many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Church and State unto aſhes?</p>
            <p>Have ſo many yeares pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and digging about us made no cure at all of our barrennes? but that we will needs have that fearfull ſentence, <hi>Cut it downe, why cumbreth it the Ground?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hath the Cycle upon our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43922:24"/>branches beene ſo utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall, that wee will needs have the <hi>Axe laid even to our root?</hi> that wee may be hewen downe, and caſt into the fire; becauſe wee will bring forth no good fruit unto God for all thoſe corrections wherewith hee hath chaſtiſed us?</p>
            <p>Shall the Lord complaine of us, as once of Iſrael, <hi>I have corrected their children in vaine; the Bellowes are burnt, the Lead is conſumed of the fire, the Founder melteth in vaine: for the wicked are not plucked away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will neither the <hi>Rod tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a Serpent,</hi> the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Rod of Government that heretofore bore Almonds of Peace, and Plenty, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

            <p>Nor the waters turned into bloud; The calme and pleaſant ſtreames of concord and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity wherewith this Land of ours was heretofore watered and refreſhed; turned into a red Sea of Chriſtian blond ſhed ſo abundantly among us.</p>

Are we ſo hardened in our ſtubbourneſſe with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people, that nothing will take us off from the purſuance of our ſins? but that wee will needs

            <p>Do we not yet perceive that we are miſerable and wretched? Do we not yet feele that wee are caught, that we are intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ſnares of confuſion and deſtruction from the Lord?</p>
            <p>That whetherſoever we flie, and which way ever wee run, the bearded arrow of the anger of the Almighty ſtill ſticketh faſt in us?</p>
            <p>The fire of his indignation ſtill meeteth us in the face, and the threatning flames thereof have encompaſſed us round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43922:27"/>ſo that we can finde no way to get out: we have turned this way and turned that way, and ſought at every corner to make our eſcape from his fury, but ſtill the Angell ſtandeth with his ſword drawne in our way, and we (like blind <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>) cannot diſcover him.</p>
            <p>It is now a long time, that this pooro miſerable Nation hath laine lowing and tumbling like a wild Bull in a net; wee have ſtrugled, and bellowed, and foamed, and fretted, and tired our ſelves with ſtriving to breake out; but the more wee have ſtrugled, the more we have been entangled.</p>
            <p>Wee ſinke ſtill more and more into the mire of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43922:28"/>The flouds and the bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes ſtill ariſe upon us, and we like the poore Dove can find no place to reſt our foote on, and yet we will not returne unto the Arke; wee have fled from it unto this Mountaine and to that hill, but the waters of deſolation ſtill aſcend up after us, and no advantage of ground hath ſecured us.</p>
            <p>Our wounds are rankled, and Gangrened, and the fretting Cankers thereof have eaten e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto our hearts, and are ready to ſeize upon the very principles of life; and yet we delay to ſeeke for a recovery; we will not admit of any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying applications that may kill the rancour of theſe devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43922:28"/>Ulcers, that we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the being of this periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nation: Doe not bee ſo fooliſh as to thinke you are ſafe becauſe the Sword is taking breath a while from the chaſe of your bloud, becauſe it ſeems to reſt it ſelfe for ſome houres after ſo full a meale as it hath made of the fleſh and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſes of this people: This tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary ceſſation (if you take not heed) may prove but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enforcement of its violence, that may ſhortly returne it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us with the greater rage, and gaine it but the better ſtomack and appetite to feaſt it ſelfe more freely hereafter in our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine. You would not think him to bee a good Polititian,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43922:29"/>that ſhould preſently conclude the ſiege to be raiſed, becauſe the roaring of the Cannon of the Adverſary is intermitted for a ſpace; that takes every Truce for a concluſion of the quarrell: Such leaſures are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times but the gaining of opportunity either for the contrivance and expediting ſome new workes or deſignes that may prove more effectuall to more ſpeedy deſtruction; A giving of us leave to fall aſleep, that wee may bee ſurprized in our ſecurity and oſcitancy. Gods reſpits of judgements if they be neglected by us, and not entertained with addreſſes of converſion and humiliation unto him, become not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movalls,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43922:29"/>but the growths of our calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; when his long ſuffering leadeth us not to repentance, it will deliver us up at length un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the greater condemnation: and every minute of his forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhall be ſet upon our ſcore, and be reckoned for by us in the advancement of our following miſeries. What though the inſtruments of death which he hath prepared be not for the preſent active upon us as heretofore? wee ſee yet they are ſtill brandiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; The miſtery of our deſolation wee ſee is working every day: The engines of our deſtruction are reſtleſſe in their motions, and nothing we ſee can ſtop them from the fatall
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43922:30"/>buſineſſe they have in hand: but they are ſtill haſtening on the ſad period of this once flouriſhing Nation, as if they had no price left them to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe their owne ſafety, but by procuring the ruine of us all. The caſe is with us as it is ſaid to have been in <hi>France</hi> in ſome part of the Reigne of the Great <hi>Henry</hi> of that Kingdome: It is <hi>impiety to ſpeake of Peace,</hi> and <hi>Treaſon to ſeeke it.</hi> All the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tenders of a pious King offering the moſt precious jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of his owne Crowne to buy the ſafety and preſervation of his people, and to diveſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of his honour, to ſave the lives and the bloud of his poore ſubjects, are ſcornfully deſpiſed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43922:30"/>and thought unworthy of an anſwer; The great Maſters of our calamities are become like the ſpleene in the body, which groweth bigg by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the reſt of the parts. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is againſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but both together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iudah: Pilat</hi> is againſt <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> againſt <hi>Pilat,</hi> but both agree together againſt Chriſt and againſt his Church. The publike miſery is the common marke that they both ſhoot at from their oppoſite ſtations. The ſhowers of bloud that have fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, have not at all aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the lowring of the skies: but, <hi>The clouds have returned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43922:31"/>the raine, Eccleſ.</hi> 12.2. They are ſtill gathering more and more thicke and gloomy about us, and threaten us againe with a more violent tempeſt. The ſharp phyſick that we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, hath indeed weakened our body, but hath not at all cured us of our diſeaſes; The evill humours are ſtill predominant, and ready to caſt us into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe, and to renew the parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſmes of our furious maladie. Doe you not perceive, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all thoſe dreames of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, That ſome have ſo boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of to themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in the ſad ſucceſſes of their proſperous impieties: who promiſed you <hi>grapes</hi> from thoſe <hi>thornes</hi> which they plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43922:31"/>and foſtered, <hi>The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents root is yet ſtill alive.</hi> The root of diviſion, diſcord, and ſedition; and that it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to <hi>bring forth a Cockatrice,</hi> and <hi>the fruit thereof</hi> to be a <hi>fiery flying Serpent;</hi> a <hi>Serpent</hi> for the poyſonouſneſſe; <hi>fiery</hi> for the fierceneſſe &amp; rage; and <hi>flying</hi> for the ſwiftneſſe of that devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith it menaceth us.</p>
            <p>What though wee have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted deepe of the Cup of that <hi>Red Wine</hi> of the divine wrath and indignation, which was <hi>filled and mixed for us</hi> in the hand of the Almighty? Be not ſecure: The dreggs of that Cup it may be juſtly feared are ſtill behind: and if we will not ſeeke to prevent it by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43922:33"/>to joyne for the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a releaſe. There is none more dangerouſly ſicke than he that is well in his ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: that is unſenſible of his diſeaſe, and takes his malady for health. And then ſecondly, I would faine put you in mind <hi>of thoſe fountaines and rootes from which our calamities flow,</hi> and upon which they grow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, and will do ſtill if we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent not, to our utter undoing.</p>
            <p>And then thirdly, I would willingly perſwade you unto this truth (not that you may know it, for I doubt not but you do, unleſſe you be ignorant of the very naturall principles of Piety,) But I would faine preſſe it upon your affections
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43922:34"/>that it may bee operative in your hearts and lives: <hi>That there is no poſsibility of obtaining a releaſe from our diſtreſſes, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from thoſe judgements which are befalne us, but from God, and that without him no outward meanes, agents, or indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours can procure it us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And than fourthly, <hi>That there is no way to obtaine this from God, but by repentance, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and faithfull prayer unto him;</hi> that we may be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up all of us to ſet about theſe buſineſſes, unto which I ſhal labor to incite you by ſome powerfull motives thereunto.</p>
            <p>And then I would entreate you to accept my poore indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for your <hi>direction, and

            <p>And after all, I ſhall offer my poore mites into your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, for <hi>your help and aſsiſtance in the exerciſe of theſe duties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord of heaven help me in the performance of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall taskes, and give his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto them for the good of this poore Nation, and to the eternall honour of his glorious mercy, to which I deſire to be a poore ſervant, though moſt unworthy in this enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>And the firſt thing that I have here to doe, is <hi>to perſwade you
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43922:35"/>that you are miſerable.</hi> That we may be ſenſible at length of the ſad and wretched ſtate of this Nation, both in regard of thoſe evills that are already come upon us, and alſo thoſe that ſeeme to ſtand at our doores ready to devoure us. As long as we are not touched with a ſenſe of our evills, we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like to looke after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. The torment of the diſeaſe is the ſollicitour of health, and the beſt advocate for the entertainment of the Phyſitian and the Phyſicke. There are two great baggs of poyſon in the ſerpentine hearts of corrupted men, that doe above all others keepe us off from the cure of our ſpirituall
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43922:35"/>diſeaſes; preſumption or ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and deſpaire of mercy: The one keeps us from taking notice of our wretchedneſſe: The other renders us hopeleſſe of reliefe. And therefore the great Phyſitian of the Church though he be not wanting in his proviſion againſt all our ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, yet he ſeemes in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſcope of his compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to have aimed at the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of theſe two. Having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained us two great Antidotes againſt them: The Law againſt Securitie and Preſumption; whoſe office is the diſcovery of the malignity of ſinne, both in its owne nature, and in the curſe and condemnation that it brings with it; For <hi>By the Law</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:43922:36"/>ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſinne, Rom.</hi> 3.20. And the ſame Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. telleth us, that <hi>he had not known ſinne but by the Law.</hi> And at the 8. <hi>verſ. Without the Law ſin was dead;</hi> That is (as I conceive it may well be underſtood) that the ſenſe of ſin is dead: that it is not felt to be alive, but is in us like a Gangrene in a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied member, that eateth on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly to the deſtruction of the body: and in the like ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication wee may perhaps not amiſſe underſtand that which followes in the 9. <hi>verſe, When the Commandement came, ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived and I dyed:</hi> That is; Sin appeared to be ſin, the ſenſe of it was quickened, and thereby I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43922:36"/>was mortified &amp; humbled, &amp;c. and thus the Law rouzeth us from our Preſumption and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this Phyſick of it ſelfe is very deſtructive, and if it ſhould be let alone, would never ceaſe, till it had brought us to deſpaire, and ſo killed us with a contrary Diſeaſe. Therefore God hath ordained the Goſpell for a Cordiall to abate and qualifie the violence of this Corroſive: to keep us from being deſperate and hopeleſſe of health: to meete with the rigour and ſincerity of the Law, and to hold us up in the hope of ſalvation, by the offers of mercy in Chriſt Jeſus. The Law is like a Lance
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43922:37"/>to open our Tumours, and to ſearch our Wounds: but as the Lance of it ſelfe cures no ſores; ſo the Law of it ſelfe heales none, but makes way only, and propares for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, which applyes the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Plaiſter thereunto. The Law is our School-maſter, and whips us unto Chriſt, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us a ſenſe of our ſinnes, and of the terrors of Hell, and the curſe that is due unto them: And then Chriſt heales us with the comforts of the Goſpell. And both theſe works muſt bee done in us, if wee meane to obtain our ſpirituall health; otherwiſe for want of the worke of the Law upon us, we may periſh through ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43922:37"/>and never know what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe we dye of; or elſe for want of the comforts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell wee may periſh through Deſpaire. It may bee ſome queſtion which of theſe two are moſt pernicious, but they are both deadly; and if the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion be which is moſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally operative in its maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Security and Preſumption wil be found, I take it, by much the more Epidemical plague of the two; and that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yea very many more periſh by this, then by that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming ſenſe of the greatnes of their ſinnes, which renders them hopeleſſe, and ſo help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. The greateſt part of the world dye of a Lethergy; the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43922:38"/>Devill deales much in <hi>Opium,</hi> and Narcoticks, that ſtupifie the ſoule; and deales with men as Phyſitians uſe to doe with thoſe whom they uſe to cut of the Stone: hee firſt caſts them into a dead ſleep, and then cuts them and mangles them how he pleaſeth, whilſt they lye ſtill and quiet, and never ſo much as cry oh! nor flinch at it, nor ſtruggle againſt it, untill at length hee cuts out their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hearts and ſoules: Hee knowes his helliſh enterprize never goes on ſo proſperouſly, as when it moves ſecretly and undiſcovered. His great care is, that his Engines may not be heard, and therefore hee ſends moſt men to hell in a ſlumber,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43922:38"/>charmed with the pleaſant Dreames of earthly proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſometimes of Heaven it ſelfe; from which they are never awaked throughly, till they finde themſelves ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the very flames of the Infernall Pit. Indeed Deſpaire it ſeemes to be but the Devills refuge, which hee ſeldome makes uſe of, but where his <hi>Opium</hi> will not worke: When he meets with ſome (and they are too few) that will not bee dandled in his lap, nor nuzled in the ſecurity of their ſins, but that they will needs be ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the wounds and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their hearts, then he ſtrives to make them kill themſelves with the Lance,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43922:39"/>preſents their ſins unto them in ſuch a dreadfull colour, and doth ſo poſſeſſe their thoughts with the apprehenſions of the greatneſſe of their iniquities, and the fearefull flaſhes of hell fire, that they cannot believe God hath mercy enough to pardon them. But the former is his more uſuall, and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall Stratagem; And therefore by the way give me leave to tell you, that I think there is a great fault in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery in theſe times, for want of the due application of the terrors of the Law unto the ſoules of men, for the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their ſinnes, which ſhould be the Trumpet to rouze them
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43922:39"/>from their ſecurity, and to fit them for mercy. Wee are all for Cordialls in theſe times; but it is eaſie to perceive, if we conſider the looſeneſſe and ſlumbering condition that we are in, that wee have much more need of Corroſives to eate away our dead fleſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Cordialls of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> do uſually rather ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our Diſeaſes then our Soules, and rather hide &amp; pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate, then cure our wounds; one maine reaſon why the worke of grace goes on no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter amongſt us in theſe dayes; and I pray God it may finde a timely Reformation. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing kills more ſurely then doth a falſe perſwaſion of our
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43922:40"/>health: And therefore we find it was the Method that the Spirit uſed unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.15, 16, &amp;c. to convince him of his great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and of his miſerable Condition, that ſo hee might lead him on unto the cure. The Angel of that Church it ſeems was conceited of his owne Workes, and was not ſenſible of the luke warmneſſe of his heart in the performance of them: that his Devotion was but halfe codled, as they ſay, therefore the Spirit puts the Searcher into his Wound; <hi>I know thy workes,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>that thou art neither cold nor hot, I would thou wert colder hot.</hi> He
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43922:40"/>ſhewes him that ſuch a temper is of no acceptance with the Almighty, who receiveth no Sacrifices that are not offered up by the fire of Divine love: nay, that it was ſo farre from pleaſing him, that it was loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome unto him, and ready, as I may ſo ſpeake, to turne the ſtomack of the Almighty, like luke-warme Water recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the ſtomacke of a man. <hi>Becauſe thou art luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme, and neither cold nor hot, I will ſpue thee out of my mouth,</hi> ver. 16. And then hee ſhewes him yet a further view of his miſery, by awaking him from the fond conceit hee had of his uprightneſſe and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: <hi>Becauſe thou ſayest I am
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43922:41"/>rich, and encreaſed in goods, and have need of nothing, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poore, and blinde, and naked. I counſell thee to buy of me Gold tryed in the fire, that thou mayſt bee rich, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As long as we are unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the vilenes an wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes of our condition through ſin, we can never be cleanſed from our iniquities; we muſt feele this burthen and groane under it, or elſe we ſhall never be rid of it. Therefore this is the order of the Spirit in the work of the healing of the ſoul, as our Saviour hath declared it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.8. <hi>When he is come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>He will reprove,</hi> or <hi>convince the world</hi> (for that I

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43922:42"/>of righteouſneſſe, of juſtification by Chriſt, who hath perfected the worke of our Redemption and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, by <hi>his going unto the Father,</hi> by his Triumphant Aſcention into the Holy place of heaven for us, where he ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth as Prince of our Salvation. Having overcome all our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemies, and gotten the victory for us, and not only ſo but from the apprehenſion of ſin he quickeneth us unto the righteouſneſſe of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and holineſſe: Becauſe by <hi>Going unto his Father, having led Captivity, Captive, hee hath received gifts for men, even for his enemiess, that the Lord God may dwell among them, Pſalm</hi> 68.18.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43922:42"/>
               <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. He hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved power to beſtow the gifts of heavenly graces and vertues, which he ſeattereth abroad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people from that trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Seat where he ſitteth, to the ſanctifying of their hearts, <hi>That the Lord God may dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them</hi> in the height and holineſſe of his Spirit; <hi>Becauſe I goe to the Father;</hi> and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid in them the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humility, and ſelfe-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt; by the diſcovery of ſinne, and raiſed up the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Juſtification by faith, and Sanctification by love thereupon; he in the laſt place convinceth them of judgment: That is, (as I conceive with ſubmiſſion unto better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43922:43"/>it may be profitably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) He leadeth them from juſtification and ſanctification, unto a comfortable hope, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation or aſſurance of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſentence from God in judgement: whereby they ſhall be inveſted into Salvation and Eternall life, Sathan their arch enemy being caſt in his ſuit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; <hi>Becauſe the Prince of this world is judged.</hi> But the firſt worke we ſee is the convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſin; And this is Gods method in healing of ſin.</p>
            <p>And we cannot chuſe a better for the curing of our miſeries. There is no greater enemy unto true happineſſe than a conceit of happineſſe where it is not; neither is there any more incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43922:43"/>miſerable, than he that will not beleeve himſelfe to be ſo. Therefore it is the ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of God againſt Iſrael; That when <hi>he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

And doe not we ſee the like ſadneſſe and mourning ſolitarineſſe in the wayes of our Sions, which lead unto the holy Mountaines and Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries of the Lord, whileſt the ſolemne Feaſts, and Memorials of the Holy Saints of God, are aboliſhed, which were ſo many Schooles of Holineſſe unto the people; calling to their minds the excellencies of the Graces of thoſe eminent and reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Lights of Piety for their imitation: and the Memorials of the moſt glorious mercies of the Lord are rejected, even of the Incarnation, the Nativity,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43922:52"/>the Paſſion, the Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and of the Glorious Fruite of all: The ſending of the Holy-Ghoſt, with ſo many Treaſures of divine Graces and mercies to the enriching of the Church, which were of ſuch excellent uſe; not only to ſtir up the people unto thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or to revive the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſenſe of Gods mercies in their hearts, whileſt they were ſo often, and in ſuch ſolemne manner preſented unto their apprehenſions by the Church: but were alſo ſo many bleſſed opportunities gained to draw the people together unto the ſolemne Exerciſe of Religion toward God, and of Chriſtian
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43922:52"/>Love and Charitie to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo many dayes of mercy to the poore beaſts, and toyling ſervants. And were of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe, for the inſtilling and preſerving of the Fundamental Doctrine of Chriſtianitie in the hearts of the people: Which ſerved in ſtead of an eaſie Catechiſme unto the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler ſort; whileſt if they were but wiſe enough to know what day went over their heads, they could not be utterly ignorant of the great Myſteries of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. An uſe of ſolemne dayes which God himſelfe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, partly for that very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the Church of the Jewes; See <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.26, 27. and ſo warranted ſufficiently
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43922:53"/>unto us. And which indeed is of great neceſſitie, in regard of the great ignorance and inep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that is in many, for the apprehenſion of the profound myſteries of Chriſtianitie: Which being ſo great ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers unto Nature, and their naturall apprehenſions, would not ſo eaſily have been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by them, but that they were by this Ordinance of the yearly ſolemnities of the Church, made familiar unto them by cuſtome, which being as it were another nature, faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated by uſe the admiſſion of that high and miſterious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge unto their ſoules: Theſe, theſe alas are all now caſt away, as if the Church could not be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43922:53"/>reformed, unleſſe Chriſt Jeſus and his glorious mercies were forgotten amongſt us. I deny not indeed but thoſe daid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> were much abuſed by ſome unto looſeneſſe and licentious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; But then it had beene true Reformation to have ſought the remedy of thoſe miſcariages, and to have redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thoſe daies unto their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and holy uſe, by making more ſtrict rules for the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and reſtraining of men unto the right obſervation of them, and ſo to have retained them to the honour of God, and edification of his people, in the due exerciſe of the workes of Piety towards God, charity and love one to another, and of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43922:54"/>mercy and releaſe to our poore Beaſts and Servants. But alas, if the matter be rightly examined, I doubt we may find that the Workes of Piety, Mercy, and charity are only caſt away, and the licentiouſneſſe and lawleſſe liberty of thoſe daies is ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, at leaſt that there is no ſuch watch ſet againſt the latter, as againſt the former. And I can hardly forbeare to tell you, that it is the right method of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Reformation, to caſt away the good and retaine the evill. They winnow with Sathans Sieve that ſhake out the good Gorne, and retaine the Chaffe and offall; ſo hee would have winnowed S. <hi>Peter</hi> no doubt; &amp; ſo ſome have now winnowed the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43922:54"/>flower of our Church. This whirlewind-Reformation of ours, hath even blowne a great deale of the Wheate from us, by caſting out the holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, the beauty and Order of his Service, together with the Government of the Church, and inſtead thereof hath left us I know not how many great heapes of Chaffe, of Corruptions, Confuſions, and Depravations amongſt us, which are ground and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto the poore deceived people, who whilſt they expect Bread to nouriſh them, finde Huskes to choake and deſtroy them. I confeſſe heretofore there was ſome Chaffe in our heapes which did deſerve a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43922:55"/>winnowing, but with a more moderate wind. But we had better have eaten the Wheate and the Chaffe together, then to have had the Wheate taken from us, and ſo much Chaffe left us in the ſtead of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be too voluminous in this ſad Subject, ſhould I draw out the Paralells of our Evils and thoſe of the Jewes.

            <p>I might tell you of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of the Adverſaries of each Church. The proſperity

            <p>Chap. 2. ver. 1. &amp;c. <hi>The cloud of Gods Anger</hi> wherewith Sion was vailed. <hi>The caſting downe of the beauty of Iſrael from heaven unto the earth:</hi> That is, from a ſtate of happineſſe and glory, to a ſtate of miſery and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. The <hi>Lords forgetting of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43922:56"/>his footſtool; his ſwallowing up of the Habitations of Iacob; the throwing downe of the ſtrong holds of the daughter of Iudah; the polluting of the Kingdome and the Princes thereof;</hi> treading them as it were in the mire in his fury. <hi>The cutting off the horne:</hi> That is, taking away the ſtrength and glory <hi>of Iſrael. The drawing back of his right hand from before the Enemy;</hi> That is, the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of his protection and defence, and his giving of them over to the fury of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. The <hi>burning flame,</hi> and <hi>the bent bow.</hi> The <hi>powring out of fury,</hi> like a ſtreame or floud of fire. The <hi>taking away of his Tabernacle as it were of a Garden;</hi> That is, either the pulling down

Theſe, and many other like theſe, are all but ſo many emphaticall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the violence and fury of Gods anger againſt that nation in thoſe times, and may ſerve for the ſame purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us in theſe ſad daies of ours. As if the Prophet had therein ſet us a Copy to write after, our preſent miſeries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were a Tranſlation of a great part of that ſad origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Text, wherein God was pleaſed to read humiliation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>I ſhall break this holy Glaſſe of the Prophet into no more pieces. You may at your lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43922:59"/>contemplate the heavy caſe of this poore Church and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſundry paſſages of it, and exerciſe your ſelves in the juſt Lamentation thereof, in thoſe ſeverall helpes that he there moſt elegantly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth to teach us the art of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow.</p>
            <p>I ſhall come more plainely, and cloſely home unto you; and entreate you of this Nation to conſider two things with me, very requiſite for the right underſtanding of our miſerable condition.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what we have been: And ſecondly, what we are, from whence we are fallen, and whether we are fallen.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider what you
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43922:60"/>have been, that by the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of your loſt proſperity you may the better take the meaſure of your incumbent miſery. This is one ſtone or weight that both ſpirituall and humane Oratory makes often uſe of. Happineſſe &amp; calamity as oppoſite neighbours as they are, yet at their departure, they many times, and almoſt alwaies leave ſome Legacie behind them unto one another; ſo that each is advanced out of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtore. Precedent calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties leave jewels and ornaments behind them, to beautifie the face of ſuccedent felicity. Health is much the ſweeter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a fit of ſickeneſſe; A calme ſeaſon at Sea ſeemes a kind of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43922:60"/>heaven unto the toſſed and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Mariner, after the blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring and tearing aſſaults of tempeſts, the raging moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and valleys of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous billowes; A fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going povertie and indigence, enricheth the ſtore of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of plenty and abundance that comes after; and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable enough, that the Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all joyes and reſt in heaven are the ſweeter and more pleaſant unto the Saints, for every por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of miſery and bitterneſſe that they have taſted in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious afflictions of this turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and tranſitory life here in this world; That of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle may be true even in this ſenſe amongſt others: <hi>That our
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43922:61"/>light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a farre more exceeding and eternall weight of glory;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Not only in regard of the great recompence that the Lord there rewards our ſufferings withall: but alſo in reſpect of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hancement and value that our ſufferings here do bequeath as it were unto our recompence there. Thus every Croſſe here, is turned into a Diadem there: The thornes of our preſent troubles, and tribulations, may ſeeme to adde ſweetneſſe unto the Roſes of our future tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility which grow upon them.</p>
            <p>And ſo on the contrary; A foregoing ſtate of happineſſe,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43922:61"/>addeth unto the burden of our ſubſequent adverſity: Poverty is a wracke indeed unto that worldling that hath lately wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the golden mires of his riches. That man that is borne blind, and never taſted with his eye of the ſweetneſſe and pleaſantneſſe of the Sunne beames, doth not find neere ſo much diſcontent in his naturall darkeneſſe, as he that hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyed the various delights of the ſeeing eye. <hi>Miſerum eſt fuiſſe foelicem;</hi> It is a wretched thing to have once been happy. <hi>Fuimus Troes, wee were once Trojans,</hi> is a Motto of a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full importance; Therefore we find it the Eloquence of the Pſalmiſts ſorrow, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 42.4.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43922:62"/>Lamenting the ſad loſſe of the comfortable Society of Gods people in the divine worſhip, by reaſon of ſome affliction that had befallen either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or the Church: To ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate that dammage upon his owne diſconſolate Spirit by the memory of the former joyfull freedome thereof which he enjoyed: <hi>When I remember theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I poure out my ſoule by me ſelfe;</hi> why ſo? Why, becauſe it had not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been ſo with him: <hi>For I had gone with the multitude, I went with them unto the houſe of God, with the voice of joy and praiſe with a multitude that kept holyday.</hi> Q. D. It grieves mee much the more to thinke what
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43922:62"/>felicity I have loſt: that I have been heretofore in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when I enjoyed the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and comfort of the holy aſſemblies, and of the full So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities in the ſacred feſtivals of the Lord. And thus that victorious Martyr of patience <hi>Iob,</hi> blazons the Armory of his ſable afflictions, of that pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of miſchiefes that made up the matter of his trialls: by ſetting forth the honourable and proſperous condition, wherein he was before they fell upon him; <hi>Iob</hi> 29.2, &amp;c. <hi>Oh that I were</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>as in mneths paſt, as in the daies wherein God preſerved me: when his Candle ſhined upon my head, and when by his light I walked
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43922:63"/>through darkeneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But now they that are younger than I have me in deriſion: whoſe fathers I would have diſdained to have ſet with the doggs of my flocke.</hi> It added much unto the tryall of <hi>Iobs</hi> patience, and to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his miſery, that he was fallen from an eſtate of ſo much happineſſe and honour.</p>
            <p>That therefore I may give you the greater and truer ſenſe of your calamities, give mee leave to deſire you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what you have been, and to compare it with what you are now: and that in theſe ſeverall regards.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In matter of <hi>Religion,</hi> Secondly, In matter of <hi>Peace.</hi> Thirdly, In matter of <hi>Liberty.</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:43922:63"/>Fourthly In point of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Fifthly, In point of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Reputation;</hi> And in all theſe, as in many more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, we ſhall finde the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairements very great that are upon us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> which is above all others of greateſt weight and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of the higheſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto happineſſe: The time was not many years ſince, that we were the glory of all the Reformed Churches: The home as it were, and proper ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of the true, ſincere, beautifull, and orderly Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: which was an Exile in moſt other places of the world: and in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43922:64"/>(as it were) but as a ſtranger, and ſojourner under the conditions of reſtraint and bondage; and rather permitted as an harmeleſſe evill, than em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced as an honourable and commodious good. Here Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was in the Throne, in other Kingdomes and Nations it was ſet as it were upon the footſtoole. In this Realme of ours it was ruling as a Miſtris, or Queene; in moſt others, it was made to ſerve as an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or ſervant. Here it was in power, and glory; and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in other places in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and ſervitude. Here it was in its free and full courſe, like a cleare and untroubled River or ſtreame, watering the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43922:64"/>ſeverall parts and territories of our Land: and conveying unto them the rich Traffique of Spirituall and Eternall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, together with the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of temporall proſperity; whereas in other places (for the moſt part) if it were at all in ſincerity, yet it was not at all in freedome and libertie: but chained up, and limited unto this or that particular ſtation, under confinement &amp; reſtraint, as if it were ſome dangerous and pernicious beaſt. Oh how comfortable and glorious was the ſtate of Religion once with us in this Nation! When it was encouraged by the Royall example of a gracious and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince: Mannaged in the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43922:65"/>hands of a Learned and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Miniſtry: Steered and carried one, (not after the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of fooliſh and frantique men, not put to Lackey by the ſide of thoſe unſanctified de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which have bin the Brood of the brains of the Achitophels of our Age:) but guided by the Load-ſtar and Compaſſe of the Divine Truth, in the true road of Eternall happineſſe: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the wholeſome rules of order and decency: Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred with an holy and awfull reverence, anſwerable in ſome kind to the Majeſtie of hat great God unto whom the acts of Worſhip were directed: Strengthened and enforced with Unity, and Chriſtian
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43922:65"/>Concord of the people of God, gathered together in the law full and orderly Aſſemblies of the People, in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are conſecrated to the peculiar ſervice of the Almighty: ſecured from blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies and other inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, by the helpe of a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and excellent ſet forme of publique Devotion, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with great deliberation and judgement by thoſe holy Martyrs, who have ſealed the Truth of God, and teſtified their ſincerity in the embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, by the loſſe of their deareſt bloud, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by the Authority of the Church. Oh how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py was it then with us! When
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43922:66"/>this Church of ours was as it were the throne of the glory of God here upon Earth: The Zodiake wherein the Sunne of righteouſneſſe had his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The choice and peculiar portion of God: The Land of Truth and Holineſſe.</p>
            <p>But now alas! what is become of us? <hi>Our ſilver is become droſſe: Our wine is mixt with water.</hi> The tried ſilver of divine Truth ſtamped with the image and ſuperſcription of God himſelfe, wherewith we were enriched, for the traffique of Heaven, is turned into the droſſe of errours and hereſies, foiſted upon us under the names of Truths. Thoſe <hi>malae monetae;</hi> thoſe counterfeit pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43922:66"/>which the Coyners and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall impoſturers of this age have put upon us, which will purchaſe us nothing but ſhame and confuſion, deſtruction and damnation: and the pure wine of the Divine Worſhip and Ordinances, that refreſhed the hearts both of Men and Angels is mixed with the muddy and unwholeſome waters of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent, unſeemely, and corrupt performances in Religion, whereby the holy heate and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is cooled, the life and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour thereof is deaded and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, and the ſoule-revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtrength and vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is rendered lawguid and forceleſſe.</p>
            <p>Not any thing left us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43922:67"/>Religion is concerned, but all is either aboliſhed and caſt off, or changed for falſe wares, or poyſoned and ſophiſticated with venomous mixtures and infuſions. The Harlot of ſchiſm and ſedition hath dealt with us, as the Harlot is charged to have dealt in the firſt of <hi>Kings</hi> the third Chap. and 20 <hi>verſe, She hath ſtolne away the living Child</hi> of true Religion and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of which this Church of ours was happily delivered by the Divine goodneſſe: and hath <hi>left her dead child of diſorder and depravation instead thereof in her boſome,</hi> and the poore deprived mother is abridged of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Her wiſe and pious <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> (oh that he were a <hi>Salomon</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:43922:67"/>in peace, as much as he is a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in wiſedome,) is kept from the Throne that he cannot heare her cauſe, and redreſſe her injurie, and reſtore unto her the living child againe; but he that is greater than <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> will we hope in his good time reſtore both.</p>
            <p>If we looke for the true and ſincere rule of Religion, the golden ſtandard of the pure and incorruptible Word of God, illuſtrated and explained unto us by the ſolid and ſound inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Antiquity. Inſtead thereof, we find the fooliſh and franticke imaginations of every preſumptuous and unlearned Enthuſiaſt, impoſing drunken dreames for the dictates of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43922:68"/>ſober and ſanctified Divinity; ſetting up themſelves for the meaſures of Religion, whileſt they take upon them a ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency over the very Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves, to mangle and cut them into what formes they pleaſe, bending and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them like that <hi>regula lesbia,</hi> like a leaden rule to make them ſquare with thoſe wicked and ſeditious deſignes that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and their carnall intereſts commend unto them for the ruine of the publike; one while corrupting them by falſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, another while de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praving them with impious additions of their owne preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded viſions and revelations, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fained by themſelves, or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43922:68"/>inſpired into them by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of errour, God having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them up to ſtrong deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they ſhould beleeve a lye, becauſe they have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the love of Truth that they might be ſaved. Yea leaſt there ſhould be left any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to croſſe them in their waies, and to hinder the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their helliſh errours, it is thought there are ſome that have taken the boldneſſe, to pull the Scriptures downe from the Throne of excellency and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility wherein God hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them, as being the dictates of his owne infallible Spirit, and to equall with them, or preferre before them, their owne wicked fancies, and the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43922:69"/>very witchcrafts of Sathan.</p>
            <p>Hence it is come to paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, that the light of true Chriſtian knowledge is ſo eclipſed amongſt us, like the Sun in <hi>caudâ draconis</hi> in the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons taile, as the Aſtronomers ſpeake; for what elſe are theſe wicked Sophiſters, theſe bold diſturbers of the Church of God, than the taile as it were of the great red Dragon ſweeping downe the ſtarres of heaven, the true and genuine lights of the Church, and of Divine knowledge.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts have gotten ſo much the ſtart of ſincere piety, and are become ſo impudent as to take upon them to give rules unto
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43922:69"/>the Spirit, to ſilence the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of he pure Word of God, to build ſanctuaries and aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum's unto the groſſeſt ſinnes, whereby they are become incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Gangrenes and <hi>noli me tangeries</hi> in the ulcered body of this Church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that there are ſo many ſuperſedeaſes, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and inhibitions ſerved upon the Scripture from the Chancery of the corrupt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or rather affections of wicked politicians, to reverſe or ſilence the Edicts &amp; decrees of the moſt high God, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezill and invalidate the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of heaven, making them ſubordinate to the impious and unſanctified ordinances of men,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43922:70"/>and allowing the ſacred and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Oracles of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to be of no force any farther than they can be wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to a ſeeming and forced compliance with thoſe wicked principles and ends that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded men have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and propoſed for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummating of that worke of ruine and confuſion that they have undertaken; which muſt be aſſerted and made good with a <hi>non obſtante,</hi> to all that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God hath declared to the contrary, whereby they ſeem to deale in ſome ſort with Chriſt Jeſus as with his ſubſtitute, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colours and faire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to render him glorious, not only attempting to make
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43922:70"/>void the authority of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall office, by diſallowing his directions to be an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and all-ſufficient guide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all truth, but alſo to depoſe him from the Throne of his Royalty by repealing and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the force of his divine Lawes, which he hath made for the rule and government of his people, whenſoever they lye oppoſite to their ſeditious and pernitious judgements; as if no act were high enough to ſhew the abſoluteneſſe of that ſupremacie which they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge unto themſelves, unleſſe the Precepts of God, as well as the Lawes of men, be made the Pavement for them to trample on at their pleaſure, in the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43922:71"/>paſſes and repaſſes that they make for the carrying on of the bold adventures of their awleſſe and Lawleſſe tyranny.</p>
            <p>Would you not thinke them the heires, if not the Ghoſts of that inſo lent Romane Senate in the time of <hi>Tiberius?</hi> And that as they refuſed to admit of our Saviour for God, <hi>becauſe he was conſecrited a God before he was ſo decrecd and approved by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:</hi> ſo theſe had determined to reject him from being God, becauſe he was not deified by their ordinance, and received not has Godhead from them.</p>
            <p>What is it elſe for them to take upon them as they do, to ſet up their owne rules in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtion to the cleare dictates

            <p>The Word of God teacheth us to celebrate the memorialls of the great bleſſings of God, and to ſolemnize his praiſe for them in the Congregations of his people. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1, <hi>&amp;c. Pſalm.</hi> 42.4.</p>
            <p>They teach men to aboliſh the memorials of the great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Salvation wrought for us by Chriſt, and forbid by their command, and hinder by force, the Miniſters of God from aſſiſting the People therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. The Law of God teacheth us to ſerve the Lord with feare, and to reioyce
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43922:72"/>unto him with trembling; to bow downe and kneele before the Lord our maker.</p>
            <p>They teach men, or at leaſt allow them, to aboliſh outward reverened from the Divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Com.</hi> The Law of God teacheth us that we ſhall do no murder.</p>
            <p>They teach men, and engage them to murder their Brethren, and to deſtroy the lives of thoſe that are innocent for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing of their wicked purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to make good the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of their unjuſt power and greatneſſe.</p>

            <p>They juſtifie the robbing and plundering of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the good and peaceable Subjects, and even the King Himſelfe, without any colour of Law or conſcience, and without ſo much as allowing many of them a hearing.</p>
            <p>The Law of God teacheth us <hi>that we must be mercifull as our Father which is in heaven is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They teach men to be cruell and bloudy, as their father in hell is cruel &amp; bloudy, who was a murderer from the begining.</p>

            <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13, 14. The Law of God teacheth us, <hi>that the Miniſters of the Goſpell ought to live of the Goſpell, as they that waited at the Altar were partakers with the Alear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now men are taught to deprive the Miniſters of God of their lawfull ſupportance and livelihood, neither allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to enjoy their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

            <p>Theſe teach men to do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt evils under the pretence of holy purpoſes, but indeed for the procurement of greater evils, making one wickedneſſe the ſcale to get up to another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 23.5. The Law of God tells us that <hi>wee muſt not ſpeake evill of the Ruler of the people.</hi>

            <p>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 13.14. The Law of God teachethus <hi>that me muſt ſubmit to the King as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame, and to Governors as unto thoſe that are ſent of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They teach the people to deſpiſe and diſobey the King, whom they are ſworne to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as their onely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Governour.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>They ſet up reſiſtance and Rebellion for a vertue: and

            <p>But they teach men (and practice it themſelves) to take the Sword, and raviſh it from the ſupreame power, and to uſe it not only without him, but againſt him, to maintaine their wicked Doctrines, their Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall deſignes, and unjuſt oppreſſions, and to beate down both truth and righteouſneſſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But they teach men not only to hold the contrary, but bind them by wicked oathes never to intereſt themſelves, nor to

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43922:90"/>apprehend what they declare therein, as by that partiality of heart which men beare either to themſelves, or ſome whom they adhere to, and by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and oppoſition againſt others, whom they are reſolved to contend with be it right or wrong, whereby they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved their owne ſoules unto errour, contention being their Jaylor; whilſt men are not ſo much contentious becauſe they erre, as they do erre becauſe they are contentious.

            <p>Hence it is, that there are daily amongſt us ſuch tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and irrationall crying down of moſt cleare and evident Truths, without ſo much as allowing them a faire tryall, or a liberty to ſpeake for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

Oh how ſoone doe we grow too old, and too wiſe to goe to Heaven! The Lord grant that they may all ſeeke to reforme it. That this ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and uſefull an Ordinance may be reſtored into credit and

Yea, although it is my hearty deſire that the preaching of the word of God, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionary way, in doctrinall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, Scripture-expoſitions, declamatory exhortations unto vertue and holineſſe, and dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from ſinne, may be more and more encouraged and promoted amongſt us: And am not at all of the opinion of thoſe men (of which ſide ſoever they are) that cry downe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43922:110"/>of the Word in that kind, as if it were the cauſe of more evill than good amongſt a people; becauſe too many have made a perverſe and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt uſe thereof, to the ſerving of their owne or others unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ends, &amp; to the raiſing of factious and ſeditious motions in the Body of the Church and State,) a miſchiefe that lyes full ſore upon our ſhoulders at this very time,) and yet of no ſuch force as to give us a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to deſire the abolition thereof from amongſt us. For this were to fall into the errour of the Papiſts, who upon the like pretence have locked up the Scriptures in unknowne tongues from the people, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43922:111"/>prohibited them the liberty of the reading of them; becauſe as it is too true (though not of all thoſe upon whom the Church of Rome would fixe the charge thereof) That many through preſumptuous ignorance, and reſting too much upon their owne judgements, and deſpiſing thoſe guides which God hath appointed for their help to lead them on ſafely, and keep them from drowning in thoſe depths: And perhaps many more through wilfull perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, have drawne poyſon from that hony, and by an ill compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and worſe application of thoſe excellent drugges that are there laid up and ordained by God for the health of our
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43922:111"/>ſoules, have procured diſeaſes, and death both unto themſelves and others. This were to be as unjuſt and unreaſonable as ſome others (that walke under a better title) in theſe times, that can find no other way of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, than like that fooliſh Vine-dreſſer, that cut up the Vines by the roots in ſtead of pruning them; to pull up the Trees of Government in Church and State, <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch,</hi> becauſe ſome boughes or ſpriggs thereof were unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or corrupted. I know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance is a great evill, and hath proved very pernicious, both unto the bodies and ſoules of men: And yet if any ſhould adviſe the Husbandman not to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43922:112"/>ſow his ground, or the houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not to provide meat and drinke for his family, or any other, abſolutely to forgoe the uſe of thoſe creatures for feare of abuſing them; It would be a hard matter to tell which were the wiſer, the giver or the taker of ſuch counſell. Many Doctors perhaps through careleſneſſe or ignorance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the greateſt diſeaſes of their Patients: And <hi>naturall</hi> bodies as well as <hi>politicke</hi> prove oftentimes to be ſicker of their Phyſicians than of their mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: And yet he were no good Phyſician, that would perſwade men to cure themſelves by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the uſe of the Phyſician &amp; of medicine. It is the expreſſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43922:112"/>command of the Spirit of God, and no pretences of humane wiſedome muſt diſſolve the force of it: <hi>Preach the word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long ſuffering and doctrine.</hi> Yea there is not only a bare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but a ſevere charge and adjuration applyed to <hi>Timothy</hi> by the Apoſtle to that purpoſe: <hi>I charge thee before God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quicke and dead at his appearing and his Kingdome. Preach the Word,</hi> &amp;c. And dare any ſay that this was for <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> only, and not for all thoſe that are called to the like office in the Church? As well they may goe about to make void
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43922:113"/>the Churches intereſt in the Goſpell of St <hi>Luke,</hi> becauſe it was dedicated to <hi>Theophilus;</hi> or deforce the Univerſall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe the firſt was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the ſecond &amp; third to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> &amp;c. As if the People of <hi>England</hi> were not bound to ſubmit <hi>to the King as Supreame,</hi> becauſe <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is not in the Title of that Epiſtle of St <hi>Peter,</hi> where this Precept is Recorded, but that it is directed to <hi>the ſtrangers ſcattered throughout Pontus, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, Cappadocia, Aſia, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinia;</hi> nay, <hi>there is no reſpect of perſons with God.</hi> Whereſoever any meet in their callings, they muſt meet in duties as they do
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43922:113"/>meet in obligations. Therefore I ſay againe, I cannot, I dare not be of their opinion, that would upon any pretences pull downe the Pulpits, or ſtrike them dumbe to prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes; and whilſt God ſhall allow me liberty, and ſtrength, and ability of performance, I ſhall alwaies hold it my duty to be exerciſed in that worke, and ſo much my duty, that I ſhall take no humane prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to bee my diſcharge, though Kings, or Parliaments, or both joyne together therein. And I wiſh there had been, and were ſtill more of my mind in this, remembring that anſwer that the Apoſtles returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inhibition of the Rulers
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43922:114"/>of the Jewes, that forbad them to <hi>ſpeake at all, or teach in the name of Ieſus,</hi> which I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſhal ferve my turne againſt any of the like ſort. <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God judge ye.

And yet though I have made all this digreſſion to ſatisfie my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the uprightneſſe of my judgement and deſires in this particular, I am not afraid to profeſſe, that if the caſe were ſo, that wee muſt needs part with one of them, it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſafer for a Church to want any other kind of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than to be deprived of the uſe of Catechiſme, which containeth the Principles of all
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43922:114"/>Chriſtian Doctrine; for where this is well managed, there can nothing be wanting in matter of knowledge that is abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation; ſo that this alone, where no more is to be had, might ſerve the turne to ſteere us unto heaven; and beſides he that hath the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples well ſetled, cannot but be made maſter thereby of many of the concluſions that flow from them.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:43922:144"/>that are deſigned by God and his Church for that purpoſe (ſuch as was <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> at <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete</hi>) that upon <hi>triall</hi> and <hi>approbation</hi> from them, and by ſolemne <hi>ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and impoſition of hands, together with <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> to God for a bleſſing upon them and their gifts, they may be admitted to that work, which is indeed very requiſite for the ſecurity of the Church and Gods people, that they may not have <hi>wolves</hi> inſtead of <hi>Sheepheards,</hi> to <hi>devoure</hi> them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>feeding</hi> them, that they may not have <hi>perverſe inſolence,</hi> and <hi>bold ignorance,</hi> but <hi>ſolid, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and <hi>modest knowledge</hi> to be their guides in the waies of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:43922:145"/>righteouſneſſe and ſalvation; that they may not receive poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon inſtead of nouriſhment, but that they may have the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milke of the Word</hi> admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto them that <hi>they may grow thereby.</hi> A matter of ſo great conſequence, as our owne lamentable experience at this day may informe us abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That although it were to be wiſhed indeed, that the Church had the enjoyment of all her ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and that nothing ſhould lye idle that may be of uſe, yet it were much better that many good gifts ſhould lye hid, then that under the collour of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in making uſe of good gifts, the people of God ſhould be bewitched, and poyſoned
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:43922:145"/>with ſo many ſophiſticated im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures of Sathan; have ſo many hereſies and errours, and phrenſies, and ſchiſmaticall, and ſeditious Doctrines put upon them inſtead of the truth of God, to the producing of ſuch a <hi>Chaos</hi> of confuſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and the enkindling of ſo many <hi>falſe,</hi> but <hi>raging fires of diviſion and diſtraction</hi> in the Church of God. It is much better that the building of the Temple ſhould go on ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the ſlower, then that the <hi>Adverſaries of Iudah and Beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin</hi> ſhould be ſuffered under the pretence of promoting, to hinder and confound the worke, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.1, &amp;c. <hi>Many hands many times makes light

In ſhort, do but ſtand ſtill a little, and conſider what excellent fruits this <hi>liberty of prophecying</hi> (as they call it) hath produced in this Church of ours, and if you can conclude it to be commodious or a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, go then and pull downe your hedges, and hire the hogs to dreſſe your Gardens and your Fields: ſet flames of fire to repaire your houſes: let the moath be your taylour to mend

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:43922:147"/>himſelfe. I know none that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to make any monopoly of the gifts of God, or of the buſineſſe of ſalvation. I doubt not but there are of the lawfull Miniſtry, that are ſo ſenſible of the greatneſſe and difficulty of the worke, that they could be content, if God would be pleaſed with it, to have any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy take the burden thereof off their ſhoulders, and ſo that they might be rid of the great charge, willingly to part with the honour and ſupportance too of their callings, much more would they be ready to receive the aide of any that were fit, and willing to helpe them, and to joyne with <hi>Moſes</hi> in that holy wiſh of his

            <p>If they ſhall ſay they are tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, approved, and admitted by the people; I anſwer, that triall is <hi>coram non judice,</hi> ſince it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not unto the people either to judge in election, or to conferre that Miniſteriall power by ordination.</p>
            <p>The firſt is againſt reaſon, fot the election of Miniſters muſt reaſonably belong unto thoſe that are able to judge of them: and as it is in Sciences, that that hath in it the rules whereby other Sciences are judged of, is held to be above the reſt in wiſdome and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, ſo in perſons or callings: now whether that can be a fit
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:43922:152"/>man to guide the people that is inferiour unto the multitude in wiſedome and knowledge, let any man judge; ſo that the very election by the multitude doth upon the matter inferre him to be unfit, and ſo that choice doth as it were deſtroy it ſelfe, and as the Muſitian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked his Scholler (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Story) becauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple applauded him, telling him that hee knew it could not be right or good Muſicke that they approved; and as a man may judge that to be crooked that agrees with a crooked rule, ſo of the two we might rather conclude that man to be unfit that the people chooſeth than to be fit: and ſo more conſonant
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:43922:153"/>to reaſon that he ſhould even therefore be rejected than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, for in that he is choſen by the people, it is to be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that they are fit to judge of him, and if they are compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judges of him, it will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be inſerred that he is inferiour to them in wiſdome and excellency, but this is not to be imagined, and therefore the concluſion holds fairely; <hi>per argumentum ab abſurdo,</hi> that the people ought not to have the choice of the Miniſter.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is againſt two maine ends of Triall and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which are firſt that the Miniſter may be ſuch as may not deceive the people, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt be ſome wiſer
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:43922:153"/>than the people to try him, or elſe they may be deceived by him in the capacity of Triers, as well as in capacity of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Learners, otherwiſe this would ſuppoſe upon the matter all Election unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in regard of this end for if they are preſumed to be able to judge of his Doctrine, there is no danger that they ſhould be deceived by it; nay, for ought I know, it will inferre no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity at all of a Miniſter, or of his teaching them, for if they be wiſe enough to examine him in point of Doctrine, or to try him in it, it is to be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that they have as much or more light than he, for that light muſt be greater that will
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:43922:154"/>diſcover the failings or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of another light: unleſſe we will have darkeneſſe to judge of light.</p>
            <p>The ſecond maine end is, that he may be ſuch as will not corrupt them by his life and converſation, that will not lead them on by ill example in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Sedition, or in any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked courſe. Now this is not likely well to be provided for by committing the Election to the people; for how ſoever the timpany of opinionate holines is become ſo generall a diſeaſe in theſe times: yet if we take not maskes for faces, if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand holines aright, or make a true ſurvey of the people, it will be found a concluſion too
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:43922:154"/>operative even in theſe times; That the greateſt part of the people are not of the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; and than if that be a true principle, that <hi>owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit ſimile, Every thing delights in that which is like it ſelfe.</hi> The major part of the people which is evill, are not in any great probability to chooſe a pious Miniſter. In ſhort, the queſtion than will be, as I have it from an Elegant Lamenter of this Churches miſeries in far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, when theſe evills which we ſuffer, ſeeme to have been but in their cradle, <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam pacto de eruditione imperiti, vel de ſapientiâ ſtulti,</hi> and let me adde, <hi>vel de probitate impii recte judicabunt? Querim. Eccleſ.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:43922:155"/>How ſhall rude and illiterate men judge of erudition? or fooles of wiſdome, or wicked men of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and righteouſneſſe?</hi> Have we not cauſe to feare with him leaſt in a popular Election the holier ſort may be overcome of the greater number, and that they may chooſe ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as in their wills, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, their lives and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are moſt conformable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves?</p>
            <p>If reaſon will not prevaile, let the Scripture be ſearched, and ſee if upon due examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it can be found that ever a meere popular Election was erected by any Divine warrant to be the gate for the Miniſtry to make entrance by into their
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:43922:155"/>Functions; I deny not there are pretences of Scripture for the purpoſe, but ſhadowes are many times much longer than their ſubſtances, &amp; if they have any ſubſtance at all in them, that note which is taken from thoſe that have ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves none of the beſt friends unto the true and genuine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church, may well ſerve to abate the force of them in this argument; <hi>Quae pro po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulari Electione à nonnullis afferri ſolent, ea naſcentium rerum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mordiis fuiſſe accommodata, ſed noſtrae aetati minùs aptè conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire; That thoſe things that are produced in behalfe of popular Election by ſome, were proper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe rudiments and beginnings
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:43922:156"/>of the church, but do not agree with the age wherein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And yet even in thoſe times there is ſufficient to be found
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:43922:156"/>to ſhew us that thoſe acts that were done, or ſeeme to be done in that way, were not intended for ruled caſes to the Church, in that it is evident in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the ſame Apoſtolicall times, that men were ſent to exerciſe the Miniſtry amongſt the people, and accordingly undertooke and performed it, without any the leaſt reference to their conſent or approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <hi>Alphonſus a Castro</hi> (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) aſcribes it unto <hi>Luther,</hi> as if it were his Doctrine, (how juſtly I have neither oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity nor luſt now to examine) That all Chriſtians are Prieſts, and that they are conſecrated to this Office in their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and that they have all equall power without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction either of Sexe or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but yet ſo, that it is not lawfull for any to exerciſe this power, <hi>Niſi per conſenſum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitatis;</hi> But by the conſent of the Community; <hi>Quia quod eſt omniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> communiter, nullusſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter poteſt uſurpare, niſi vocetur;</hi> becauſe no man canſingly uſurp that power which belongeth

It might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to diſcover the folly of theſe pretenders, to tell them what exception one hath made againſt the force of that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they would draw from the named places: <hi>Si ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil eſt Sacerdotis officium quia omnes vocaniur Sacerdotes, opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebit eadem ratione te fateri ut Chriſtus nihil ſit ſupra quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam corum de quibus dictum est, nolite tangere Chriſtos meos.

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:43922:174"/>of Rebellion,</hi> and, as if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe were a malignant, that his <hi>peculium,</hi> the portion of his houſe and worſhip ſhould not only be <hi>Sequeſtred,</hi> but wholly <hi>alienated</hi> from him, as if it were the lawfull prize of thoſe whoſe uſurped power &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe knowes no limits either in heaven or earth. But it is too too cleare an evidence that they have fought againſt <hi>God,</hi> that make his <hi>Sacred Portion</hi> the <hi>ſpoile</hi> of their <hi>victory:</hi> for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours (if I miſtake not) do not uſually make a prey of their friends but of their enemies, and then the plundering of Gods houſe is no good marke of <hi>an holy Warre,</hi> nor the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation thereof by Law, any
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:43922:174"/>good Symptome of <hi>an holy ſtate.</hi> But they will ſay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that theſe Lands and emoluments though they weare the title of Gods Intereſt, yet they were dedicated to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious purpoſes; The blind and fooliſh zeale of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours had ſo eaten up their braines that they had not wit enough to keep their owne; theſe things were gotten from them by evill Arts, and falſe pretences, upon erroneous and hereticall conſiderations of no truth nor value: ſuch as are thoſe two great cheates and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures of the Church of <hi>Rome, Purgatory,</hi> and <hi>Merit,</hi> and as they were gotten <hi>per malas artes,</hi> by evill arts, ſo they
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:43922:175"/>were dedicated to evill and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious uſes; as to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of that Romiſh Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon of the Maſſe, Prayer for the dead, worſhipping of Saints, adoration of Images, for the ſupportance of a falſe Prieſthood and Sacrifice ſet up in oppoſition to, and dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Prieſthood and Sacrifice of Chriſt, for the adornation of the Temples of Idols, and for the holding up of many ſuperſtitious orders and diſtinctions of idle Monks and Friers, &amp;c. And the fruits and effects thereof have been not much better, even none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the Pride, Luxury, Sloath, Tyranny, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and many other miſchiefes
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:43922:175"/>in the Miniſtry: the devouring of Families, and impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Civill State, with the reducing of Judaiſme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us in Tithes and Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, which were indeed things proper and peculiar (as they boldly affirme) unto the Jewiſh Oeconomy and adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the old Teſtament, as was alſo the difference between things Sacred and Profane; which to bring in or continue in the time of the Goſpell were to deny the comming of <hi>Christ,</hi> and to make void the fruit thereof unto the people, to countenance the Jew in his expecting yet another <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> and to raiſe up the Spirit of <hi>Bondage</hi> againe, in putting that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:43922:176"/>intollerable <hi>Yoke</hi> of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies laid <hi>upon the necks</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Diſciples, which neither they nor their fathers were able to beare.</hi> Theſe, and ſuch as theſe are the pleas, and colours, that muſt paint over this Strumpet of Sacrilege, and turne the Robbery of God into a pious Reformation: yea, we muſt be perſwaded hereby that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege was but a Jewiſh ſinne, and that there is no ſuch thing at all in the Chriſtian Church, or if there be any thing alive now under that name, it is not a vice but an eminent vertue. Oh the pernicious &amp; bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sophiſtry of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe! Sad and dangerous is the condition, hard and hazzardous
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:43922:176"/>the warfare of thoſe truths which are to fight againſt the Militia of Mammon in this age: when once the hearts of men have ſet up that great <hi>IDOL-GAINE</hi> into the place of God, and put profit for Godlineſſe, what verity is ſo awfull but will paſſe away in their Market? What ſinne ſo deformed but ſhall finde a vaile in their Wardrobe, under which it ſhall be counted as a piece of innocency, nay, as a point of wiſedome and piety? What iron wickedneſſe ſo hard or unconcoctable but the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtomacks of theſe <hi>O ſtriches</hi> will digeſt it and put it over? But if there be no ſuch ſin as Sacrilege in the time of the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:43922:177"/>Goſpell, why doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aske that impertinent queſtion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Thou that abhorrest Idols, doſt thou commit Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege?</hi> Why doth the Apoſtle wrong this vertue ſo much, as to yoke it together with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? as if they were ſins of the like nature, to rob God of that which is devoted and due unto his worſhip and honour, and to give that which is Gods due unto another? Or why did God himſelfe provide ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy an Executioner to execute that dreadfull ſentence of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> upon thoſe two Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts, <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> by cutting them both off by a ſtrange, ſudden and exemplary death, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.5. &amp;c. <hi>For</hi> but

               <hi>keeping backe ſome part of the price of that Land which they ſold,</hi> and pretended to <hi>offer</hi> up <hi>at the Apoſtles feet?</hi> Or how I beſeech you comes it to paſſe, that Chriſt is become ſuch an Alien amongſt us, as not to be allowed capable of a donation, or inheritance? Or how is it that he hath forfeited his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt? Were the Jewes thinke you true witneſſes againſt him; That he was a perverter of the Nation, a teacher of Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, forbiding men to pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that he was a Traitour in making himſelfe a King? Or if they were, ſurely theſe are ſuch vertues now, that they might rather according to the Doctrine and practice of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:43922:178"/>this Age, give him a title too more, rather then forfeit any of his peculiars? Or have men a freedome and libertie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow their Lands and their Goods at their pleaſure upon the devill in Luxury, and Pride, and Luſt, and Cruelty, and in the ſupport of that helliſh traine of coſtly ſins which are the glory of our times? And is it only unlawfull, or a void act, for men to give any thing to the Service of God? It is our honour, and Gods great goodneſſe that he is pleaſed to ſtand in need of us, not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he cannot; for as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all from him, ſo in that reſpect we may ſay unto him in ſome ſort as he unto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour:
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:43922:178"/>
               <hi>Nec tua fortuna</hi> (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the word) <hi>deſiderat remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerandi vicem, nec noſtra ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reſtituendi potestatem:</hi> The <hi>ſtate of all-ſufficiency in him, doth neither require any remuneration, nor the ſtate of indigency and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty in us, ſuggeſt unto us any power of reſtitution;</hi> but we muſt ſtill cry out in all our offerings to God in the voice of holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11, &amp;c. <hi>All that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine: who are we that we ſhould be able to offer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For all things come of thee, and of thine owne have we given thee.</hi> But yet it is the honour he is pleaſed to do unto us, his poore Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to ſend unto us by his Servants in the ſtate of his
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:43922:179"/>Exaltation, as he did once by his Apoſtles in the ſtate of his humiliation, with a <hi>dominus opus habet, The Lord hath need of us;</hi> he is pleaſed to ſtand in need of us in his Members, in his Miniſters, in his Houſe, and in his Service, which as he hath ordained for us, ſo he lookes they ſhould be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by us. If then God hath need of us, and is capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from us, and we not at all forbidden, but moſt highly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give unto him, ſhall not thoſe Vowes be as Sacred in the time of the Goſpell, whereby ſuch gifts are confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſolemnly dedicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Worſhip and Service of God, as ever they were in the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:43922:179"/>time of the Law? Is it not as reaſonable that our Miniſtry ſhould have a ſupportance as their Prieſthood? Is it not Gods own Ordinance, that <hi>they that preach the Goſpell ſhould live of the Goſpell</hi> now, as well as heretofore that <hi>they that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the Altar ſhould live by the Altar?</hi> Or muſt the <hi>Oxe</hi> only <hi>be muzzled that treadeth out</hi> this <hi>Corne?</hi> Or is not faith to be kept with God now (thinke wee) as well as then?

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:43922:181"/>the world to come. Be not like unto the fooliſh <hi>Eagle</hi> in the Apologue, that tooke the fleſh from the Altar to feed her young with, leaſt the inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Coale</hi> of the Divine Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſet both thy neſt and thy young on fire, and thou periſh together with them in the flame. Be not ſo fooliſh as to imagine, that all things that were ordained in the Church of the Jewes were aboliſhed by the comming of Chriſt; ſome things were of order, ſome things for unity, ſome things there were for helpes unto mens affections, as Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; ſome things for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement of their memories, as the writing of the Law in
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:43922:181"/>ſuch manner as might make it obvious unto them; ſome things for the neceſſary and comfortable ſupportance of Gods Worſhip, the Officers and Inſtruments thereof; other things were properly ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and of a typicall uſe; ſome were of a mixt nature; be not carried away with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt the truth; take not the hire of Sathan in the propoſall of advantages, (as too many have done) to betray thy judgement and thy conſcience unto thy filthy and inſatiable avarice; Bee not thine owne <hi>Iudas,</hi> that thou maieſt fill the Bagg of that theefe corruption within thee, that would cheate thee to the deare purchaſe of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:43922:182"/>Thine owne ruine: but take theſe rules rather to ſatisfie all doubts, and to anſwer the pleas of <hi>Sathan</hi> for this evill. Firſt, <hi>Things properly ceremoniall, that were meere types and figures of Chriſt, are aboliſhed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of him who is the Subſtance:</hi> and <hi>what was the effect of this abolition?</hi> Even the ſame, and none other than that which is the effect of the abolition of every Law; <hi>to leave the things enjoyned or forbidden in the very ſame ſtate and condition that they were in before the Law, and ſhould have continued in if the Law had never bin made.</hi> The ceremonial Law made many things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent before, to become either neceſſary or unlawfull, it made
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:43922:182"/>them that had before no ſuch uſe at all in them, to become types and figures of Chriſt, and of things to come. <hi>What does then the Abolition of this Law do?</hi> Why <hi>clearely, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves all that that the Law added or put upon them,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>the neceſsity of things enjoyned, the unlawfulnes of things forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the legall or typicall uſe of both, and leaves the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſame naturall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that they were in before.</hi> This is the voice of reaſon, and reaſon will receive it, &amp; would thereby end ſome quarrels if it might be heard, and diſcover the <hi>miſtake</hi> of thoſe that thinke <hi>that the abolition of the ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law, made the matter of the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:43922:183"/>Ceremonies unlawfull.</hi> It left them indifferent if they were ſo before, but makes it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to uſe them as types, or as things of neceſſity. Brevity is obſcure, and that I muſt now labour for, but underſtanding and peaceable men may make good uſe of this. I intend by Gods grace to ſay ſomething more fully hereof hereafter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Things of order, of helpes of affections, of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, and the like, as the generall reaſons remaine ſo they may be uſefull, the uſe of ſuch things is not forbidden for ſuch purpoſes, they were only ſhadowes that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Subſtance chaſed away.</p>
            <pb n="315" facs="tcp:43922:183"/>
            <p> Thirdly, Ordinances of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as they have the ſame reaſon ſtill, ſo they are no way aboliſhed by the abolition of the Law of Ceremonies, but may be continued without any offence, for the like purpoſes in the time of the Goſpell, for which they were inſtituted in the time of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> for the ſupportance and furniture, and ornament of the Worſhip of God, and the inſtruments thereof: yea, it is not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full but neceſſary that the ſame (or as liberall a proportion as that, and that certaine) ſhould be allowed for the maintenance of Goſpell-Worſhip, as was allowed for the Miniſtry of the Law; for if the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:43922:184"/>of the Goſpell be more glorious, it is againſt all reaſon that it ſhould be allowed leſſe honour, or a leſſe comfortable ſupportance. It is the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> argument, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>Doe yee nos know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that they which minister about holy things, live of the things of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Goſpell ſhould live of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell:</hi> for if it be a good rule, that <hi>ſicut ſe habent ſimplicia ad ſimplicia, ſic ſe habent comparata ad comparata; As things in their ſimple and abſolute conſideration heare themſelves to one another, ſo the like proportion holdeth in their compariſons with one another.</hi> Then I know not how it can be
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:43922:184"/>reaſonably denied, but if it will follow from the allowance that was ordain'd for the Miniſtry of the Law, that there ought to be an alowance for the Miniſtry of the Goſpell, becauſe this as well as that is the worſhip of God, &amp; the means of Salvation unto the people, which cannot be performed without the paines &amp; labour of the Officers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, &amp;c. It will follow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the miniſtration of the Goſpell is a more holy, and more excellent kind of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently conducing to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, and requires at leaſt as much diligence and labour in the Miniſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it ought therefore to have
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:43922:185"/>at leaſt as large; nay a more large and a more comfortable ſupportance. And it is not, nor can be ſo comfortable, unleſſe it be <hi>certaine,</hi> and <hi>ſetled;</hi> for no man can deny, but there is more comfort in an aſſured and ſetled allowance, than in that which is onely at pleaſure, or elſe why ſhould any man give more for a leaſe for life or yeares, than for a tenancy at will? And therefore though in the time of the firſt rudiments of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, the Church could not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſuddaine attaine unto ſuch a ſettlement, partly for want of the Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and partly by reaſon of the afflictive condition of the Church, which in thoſe times
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:43922:185"/>required and produced a kinde of community amongſt thoſe that were throughly eſtabliſht in Chriſtianity, who brought all as it ſeemes to the Apoſtles feet, and partly for feare of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending thoſe that were not yet eſtabliſhed, leſt they ſhould be frighted by <hi>worldly reſpects</hi> from the embracement of the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> Yet where the <hi>Goſpell</hi> is <hi>ſetled</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> by the authority of the Magiſtrate, it is moſt requiſite that there ſhould be as a liberall, ſo a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and ſetled allowance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Miniſterie, not onely for their encouragement in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of that great charge that they have upon them, but alſo to <hi>free them from</hi> manifold <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:43922:186"/>and <hi>ſnares,</hi> that tye in the dependance upon the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and uncertaine ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of the people.</p>
            <p>For firſt, in ſuch a caſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, the Miniſter cannot likely but be much confounded in the diſpoſing and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of his expences and proviſions, his Revenues being ſtill upon uncertainties, and not onely <hi>alterable,</hi> but quite <hi>extinguiſhable</hi> upon every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the people. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences whereof are like to be not only <hi>diſturbance of mind</hi> and <hi>distraction;</hi> but alſo a great <hi>impediment unto</hi> the exerciſe of his <hi>Hoſpitality</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> ſince he can ſcarce poſſibly tell how to regulate it: <hi>For hee that
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:43922:186"/>knoweth not what he hath, cannot know what he can ſpare.</hi> If any ſhall here reply, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is to depend upon Gods Providence, I anſwer; that is the duty of every Chriſtian as well as the Miniſter; and yet it is not held at all unlawfull for the workman to agree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand for his wages. Nor doe thoſe that preſſe this, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hold it or practice it as a Duty, to leave it to the wills of their tenants, and ſo to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God moving them, what Rents they ſhall receive from their lands for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. The Miniſterie of the Jewes was equally bound to depend upon Gods providence with the Miniſtery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:43922:187"/>and had as cleare promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for temporall things as we; and yet the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to provide againſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by allowing them a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine proportion. But then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Thereby the Miniſter is too dangerouſly expoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>deſire to pleaſe men,</hi> and to preach <hi>placentia,</hi> to <hi>play that tune that they are pleaſed to dance,</hi> left he be turned away without his reward.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is a meanes to diſcourage the Miniſter in the reproofe of ſinne, when hee knowes that he may not onely loſe the Peoples favour, but their ſupply too; when by ſuch a courſe the people are made as it were his Judges, and enabled
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:43922:187"/>to cenſure and mulct him whenſoever hee doth not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is likely to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion many <hi>temptations to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content</hi> and <hi>partialities</hi> of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, between the Miniſters and people, as they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, or decreaſe, afford or take away their Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, experience teacheth us, that this hath beene too fruitfull a <hi>nurſery of Schiſmes,</hi> and <hi>Factions,</hi> and <hi>Diviſions</hi> in the Church. As wee may ſee too clearely in the Diviſions of theſe times, which are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently knowne to bee ſet a foot, much more by thoſe, if not altogether by thoſe, who
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:43922:188"/>have had their dependency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the voluntary ſupplyes of the people, than by others of the Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, this would bee too much <hi>encouragement for wicked men</hi> to go on in open and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous iniquities, when they know that they have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſuch a <hi>key</hi> unto the Miniſters mouth, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe we nor they ſhould not yeeld unto any of theſe, nor unto any other temptations: But <hi>in the regulating and orde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring of the publick matters of a Church, it is a point of Christian wiſedome, to provide as much as may be againſt ſinne, by ſetling all things in the ſafeſt way, againſt temptations, and humane weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſses
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:43922:188"/>on all ſides.</hi> And this is done herein by a ſetled and competent allowance to the Miniſterie. And though I confeſſe there may bee ſome doubt made, whether that very preciſe proportion of the tenth part be abſolutely neceſſarie in ſimple and primary conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now under the time of the Goſpell, as under the time of the Law: Yet firſt, I know no Arguments that they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it to prove the contrary. The beſt that they can doe. I concerne, is but to infuſe ſome doubt and ambiguity into the matter, and then <hi>in a Queſtion of Title between God and us, it is much ſafer for us to yeeld than to ſtand to the hazzard of a triall
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:43922:189"/>with God at the laſt day,</hi> when wee ſhould have nothing left to make reſtitution with, but our ſoules, and the forfeiture may be out eternall damnation. All the <hi>over-plus</hi> that is paid unto God, God will aſſuredly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore, if we doe it with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian heart: But if wee hold back any thing that is his due, it may be purchas'd to us at too dare a rate, both in judgments here, as is often ſeen, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and notable ſtories col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> and his ſonne Maſter <hi>Clement Spelman,</hi> and others, of Gods revenge againſt Sacrilege may informe us; and if we take not heed in greater judgments here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <pb n="327" facs="tcp:43922:189"/>
            <p> And then ſecondly, it may be ſome preſumption for any to undertake to finde out a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer way than God himſelfe found out, as was this way of tithing unto the Miniſterie, whereby God provided excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently both for the <hi>Miniſterie,</hi> and the <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Miniſterie,</hi> that they ſhould bee free from that enſlaving dependance upon the people; and yet ſtill learne to live upon the Providence of the Almighty, according whereunto their revenue and ſupportance was meaſured forth unto them every yeare: and that thereby the Miniſter might bee continually put in minde of his duty and charge
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:43922:190"/>over the people, from whoſe hands hee received his ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the people, who were thereby firſt ſecured, that their allowance unto the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, beſides their voluntary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, ſhould bee no more than ſuch as ſhould bear a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent proportion to their commings in, ſince in this courſe the allowance of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters or Prieſts increaſed, and decreaſed, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and decreaſe of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and commings in.</p>
            <p>And withall, the people were hereby <hi>continually urged to remember the fountaine of their temporall bleſsings,</hi> by their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>firſt fruits</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:43922:190"/>the ſervice of God: And withall, it might put them in minde of the holy uſe whereby they ought to ſanctifie all the reſt unto God, which they did as it were conſecrate to him in the tithes and firſt fruits; for theſe may ſeem to have beene <hi>Gods earneſt,</hi> whereby wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all the reſt to bee his due; and in the payment whereof we doe upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter devote and conſecrate all the reſt unto God to be uſed in his ſervice and to his glory, though not in his peculiar ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne worſhip. A meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worthy of our ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: And if I bee not much miſtaken, this is the true thought &amp; affection wherewith
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:43922:191"/>Chriſtians are, as well as Jewes were, to pay their tithes and offerings. It is no Judaiſme, but our duty ſtill to conſecrate and dedicate all we have unto God. To vow this and perform it, is a very acceptable ſervice. The paying of thithes I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is ſtill an engagement to uſe our whole Eſtates to Gods honour: and wee are to doe it as the paiment of our homage unto God, therein acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſupreme Lordſhip and Dominion, and giving pledge of our duty in the due imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all: as alſo of our thankfulneſſe unto God for that which wee have. If men would pay their tithes in this manner, they ſhould have no
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:43922:191"/>cauſe to repent it, neither here nor hereafter; The benefit thereof would bee much more theirs in their engagement of themſelves thereby unto their ſpirituall and Chriſtian duties, than the Miniſters in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of his temporall neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, in the greateſt doubt that can be made hereof, it is to be conſidered how <hi>excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dangerous it is to trust the deceitfull pleas of our hearts in a matter of</hi> Meum <hi>and</hi> Tuum, <hi>between God and us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And fourthly, it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable that <hi>Tithes</hi> were <hi>not proper to the Aaronicall Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> which was the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Prieſthood that was abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:43922:192"/>
               <hi>but alſo to the Melchiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian Prieſthood,</hi> which is <hi>the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Chriſts prieſthood,</hi> &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeem in great probability, if not demonſtratively, to ſtand ſtill due unto Chriſt; and ſo to be due ſtill unto him. And how can they bee paid more properly unto him, than in the ſupportance of his ſervice? and in that it continued in both theſe Prieſthoods, it appeares me thinkes thereby that it was no part of the Ceremoniall Law, but a thing common both to the miniſtration of the Law, and the Goſpell, which were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally preſented in thoſe two Prieſthoods, as I may ſo ſpeak: For the Law was changed in the change of the Prieſthood,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:43922:192"/>as the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> teacheth. This <hi>Ordinance of Tithes</hi> therefore continuing, as well as the <hi>Ordinance or office of bleſsing</hi> in both thoſe ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Prieſthoods, it appeares thereby to bee none of that changeable Law that is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. I deſire the Reader to excuſe my engagement to bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, ſo far as to ſave me ſome labor here, by caſting a diligent eye upon the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> from the 1. Verſe to the 18. as alſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18, 19, 20. Verſes. Let theſe things bee ſeriouſly conſidered, and if they bee of weight, let them prevaile to end this quarrell; and let not covetouſneſſe and envy bee heard any more againſt reaſon
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:43922:193"/>and Scripture: nor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of mens owne ends bee ſet up for Religion; nor Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for the true God. If there be any paralogiſme, or any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſſe in theſe arguments, I refuſe not to have them ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by any mans pen that ſhal pleaſe. When their failing is diſcovered unto me, I ſhall be willing to relinquiſh them, and not hang this concluſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer upon them.</p>
            <p>But then fifthly, I deſire it may be conſidered, that this way of tyranny holds excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent correſpondence with that Command of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Let him that is Catechiſed,</hi> (I ſeldome heare
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:43922:193"/>that word, but I thinke of the ruines of our Church through the neglect hereof: And I can hardly paſſe by it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing my complaint) <hi>or taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth or Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſeth in all good things.</hi> Which cannot bee exactly and orderly done (and let the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Babel</hi> ſay what they wil, all things are the better for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) unleſſe by that or ſome ſuch like way.</p>
            <p>And then ſixtly, the rule wil hold <hi>à minori</hi> as before, that the proportion ought not to be leſſe, but rather greater than that of the legall Miniſterie: So <hi>that either tithes or more will bee due:</hi> and why <hi>firſt fruits</hi>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:43922:194"/>ſhould bee forgotten I know not.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, however the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be, at the worſt that is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, The <hi>Abrogation</hi> of the Law had left tithing <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> as it had been ſo before the Ceremoniall Law was given, by the rule afore ſet downe and declared; and if it be of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different nature, and ordinable unto the promotion of Gods glory, it may be the ſubject &amp; matter of a Vow, and of a Law both Eccleſiaſticall and Civil; and then in caſe where they are devoted, and that by the will of the dead, the moſt ſacred and inviolable bond, and the moſt authenticall and irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable act of humane power
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:43922:194"/>in its kinde, and eſtabliſhed by Law, both Eccleſiaſticall and Civill. They are to bee paid with great fidelity, and that out of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> And though the Law might be abrogated, and that it had not, as perhaps it hath in caſes of this kinde, the nature of a publicke Vow, yet as long as the <hi>private Vow</hi> of the <hi>giver,</hi> and the <hi>Will of the dead is irrevocable,</hi> there had need to be much greater reaſon than is pretended for the violation. But I muſt away.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe evaſions, (for they are no better, and covetouſneſſe, will ſtraine hard, but it wil find one tricke or other to cheat the Conſcience withall) whereby the <hi>Reformers</hi> of theſe times, as
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:43922:195"/>too many heretofore, would faine juſtifie the alienation of tithes and other things conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to God and the Church. <hi>viZ.</hi> That the grants thereof were procured by erroneous perſwaſions; and upon falſe grounds, as was the opinion of merit, of ſatisfaction for ſinne, of obtaining deliverance out of Purgatory, and the like; and that they were given to evill ends, as to the ſupportance of Idolatry and Superſtition, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of true Religion, and the ſincere worſhip of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have beene anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and anſwered over and over by farre more learned and able pens, and ſufficiently to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of any that have not
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:43922:195"/>enſlaved their judgements and reaſon to the partiall opinions and admirations of mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or to their owne corrupt affections and wordly intents, whereby they have made good that ſaying of the wiſe man, Proverbs 27.22. <hi>Though thou ſhouldſt bray a foole in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, among Wheat with a Peſtle, yet will not hts fooliſhneſſe depart from him.</hi> And that of <hi>Petraach, algidum in cinerem nequicquam flabis, Hee that blowes into the cold aſhes, ſhall doe no good thereby, but make them flye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his eares.</hi> Or what <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> ſaid long agoe of thoſe that are bewitched with the love of riches:</p>

            <p>And firſt to reply to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe evaſions; That
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:43922:196"/>though it be too probable that many things were given in this kinde in the times of the blindneſs of Popery, upon ſuch erroneous grounds and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as are before ſet downe, (and it is our great ſhame that their errors ſhould bee more fruitfull than our truths) yet it will bee an hard matter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for them to prove which of them were ſo procured, or given; or to aſſure themſelves that there were not joyned with thoſe ſuperſtitious apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſome mixtures of better thoughts, that might bee ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make good the intereſt of God and his Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Secondly, that long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription doth make good
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:43922:197"/>thoſe acquiſitions that are founded in errour and miſtake; for though it bee a rule in the Civill Law, that <hi>quod initio vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſum eſt non poteſt tractu tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris convaleſcere;</hi> yet this rule hath this exception, <hi>viz. Niſi haec duo ſimul concurrunt. ſc. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii ceſsatio &amp; noviſsimus actus.</hi> Thirdly, that it may bee very dangerous in theſe dayes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſuch a principle, that thoſe grants are invalid that are obtained upon falſe pretences and perſwaſions: For this would entrench ſhrewdly upon the validity of the <hi>Act</hi> ſome yeares ſince obtained from his Majeſty, for <hi>the continuation of this preſent Parliament,</hi> which was granted upon other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:43922:197"/>and perſwaſions than doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whit agree with thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherein it hath beene ſince employed. Fourthly, give me leave to propoſe this <hi>Dilemma</hi> unto all mens conſciences, that are any way concerned in this point. <hi>Either thoſe errors that are ſuppoſed to be the inducements of thoſe donations, made them void or no; if it did not make them void, they ſtand good unto the Church; if it did make them void, then without doubt it ought to returne unto the heires of the Donours, who ought not to ſuffer for the fraud of others, or their Fathers folly or ſuperſtition.</hi> What then hath any body elſe to do either to take them away, or to buy or ſell them?</p>
            <pb n="344" facs="tcp:43922:198"/>
            <p> Fifthly, falſe perſwaſions or grounds, where the party gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is faulty in the admiſſion of them, doe not ſeem to make voyd conceſſions; eſpecially when they are confirmed with ſacred Bonds: Or if ſo, how came it to paſſe, that the league of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> who deceived them with their <hi>old ſhooes,</hi> and their <hi>old bottles,</hi> and their <hi>mouldy bread,</hi> and with a plaine downe right lye, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 9.4.9. &amp;c. was yet ſo firme and laſting, that the breach thereof was ſo ſeverely puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by God ſo many hundred yeares after: as you may ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1, 2, 3 Verſes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond evaſion I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>That a ſuperſtitious uſe or
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:43922:198"/>intention, or emploiment, doth not make void the Vow, or the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of a thing dedicated, much leſse render it uncapable of being employed in the true worſhip and ſervice of the Almighty.</hi> God himſelfe pronounced <hi>the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of</hi> Korah <hi>and his company to be hallowed,</hi> though they were conſecrated in a ſuperſtitious and unwarrantable way, and uſed in a falſe worſhip, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.38. and therefore though they muſt not bee uſed in that particular way in which they were dedicated, yet the Lord gives order to have them made into <hi>broad Plates for the Altar;</hi> and that is indeed <hi>the right cure of things dedicated to ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſes, not to alienate them from the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:43922:199"/>Church, &amp; ſo turne them from the the ſervice of ſuperſtition to be the inſtruments of pride, and luſt, and luxury, and rebellion; but to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate them unto thoſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are truly religious.</hi> See the Story of <hi>Gedeon offering Sacrifices unto God, with the wood of the Grove, Iudg.</hi> 6.26. <hi>And that by the command of God, and of the bringing backe the Veſsels of the Temple to Ieruſalem,</hi> Ezr. 1.11. &amp; 5.14, 15. &amp; 6.5. &amp; 7.19. &amp; Neh. 13.9. So wee ſee theſe evaſions are no juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; But without doubt <hi>the gaine is the godlineſse; there lyes the ſweetneſſe of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with theſe men. Demetrius</hi> and the <hi>Crafts-men may crie up Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> but the <hi>gaine,</hi> and the <hi>profit</hi>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:43922:199"/>that came in by the <hi>ſilver ſhrines, that was the Diana that they worſhipt.</hi> Had it not beene for that, they would perhaps have cared alike for <hi>Diana</hi> and for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And men in theſe dayes may talke of <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> (and I would to God wee could ſee them once ſet about a true one;) but it is too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of their <hi>Reformation</hi> is, even the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and the robbing of the Church Revenues, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching themſelves with the ſpoile of the Miniſterie, and the Houſe of God, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding of themſelves into the poſſeſſions of other men. <hi>It is an ill ſigne when theſe Cookes of Reformation greaſe themſelves
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:43922:200"/>and lick their fingers ſo much in the dreſsing of it,</hi> it is like to be but a ſlovenly piece of Cooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Had the Church been <hi>poor enough,</hi> perhaps it had ne're been medled with by theſe men; and therefore wee ſee this hath been the great buſineſſe: The Biſhops Lands have been ſold, and the Malignants, as they are pleaſed to ſtile them, have been ſequeſtred: And in order to that and ſome other good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, they have beene pulled downe. But for any matter of Reformation in any thing elſe, what great matters have been done? What is the glorious iſſue of theſe ſeven yeares la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?</p>
            <p>As for thoſe evill fruits
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:43922:200"/>that are ſo much cryed out of, as Pride, Ambition, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Luxury, Worldlineſſe in <hi>Church-men,</hi> &amp;c. I deny not but there have beene ill uſes made of Gods bleſſings as well by us of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy as by others; and wee moſt willingly acknowledge Gods juſtice in making uſe of the injuſtice and oppreſſions of men to ſcourge us for our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, and to deprive us of thoſe mercies and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which we have uſed no better. But firſt, this is not the fault of the revenues, but of thoſe that abuſed them; and then againe this might have beene remedied by a better courſe; by wholſome Lawes
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:43922:201"/>for the reformation of ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes. Thirdly, as Riches have their temptations, ſo hath poverty too. We do not find it is alwayes the mother of piety. The old ſaying is too ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true, that <hi>Neceſsitas cogit ad turpia; Need ſets men upon uncomely and unjustifiable actions.</hi> Fourthly, there are temptations alſo in the riches of the Laity; and if all matters bee rightly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, it will bee found that their Honours and revenues have yeelded no better fruits in them, than thoſe which are charged upon the Clergy; let the world judge. But will you heare ſomething out of a <hi>Church-complainant,</hi> in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Dayes, taxing the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:43922:201"/>like fault in ſome Reformers of that time: <hi>Pamphagum quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Helluonem ſpurciſsimum, cum ad convivia invitatus eſſet, in delicatiores cibos ſordes conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſe ferunt; Vt ſolus quibus vellet veſceretur: &amp; certè quâ o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim aviditate, gurges ille atque helluo ad cibos accerſit: eadem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatores noſtri ad devorandas Eccleſiae opes accerſiſſe mihi vide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

It is ſaid of one</hi> Pamphagus <hi>or</hi> Eate-all <hi>a moſt filthy Glutton, that when hee was invited to a Feaſt, hee went and caſt ſome filth or durt into the moſt delicate diſhes, that he might
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:43922:202"/>enjoy them wholly to himſelfe: Iuſt ſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doe our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers ſeeme to us to have addreſſed themſelves to the devouring of the riches of the Church. They caſt durt upon the Churches Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and condemne them as the fountaines and cauſes of much miſchiefe; but it is that they may gaine them to themſelves.</hi> And truely that is but an unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tricke, to ſpit in the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to deprive others of it, and then to eate it all themſelves. But give me leave to propound unto them ſome few interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories out of the ſame Author: <hi>Si divitiis virtutem enervari ſtatuant: quid divitiis circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluere tam vehementèr conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt? Si opum abundantiâ Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:43922:202"/>puritatem concidiſſe exiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, quid tanti mali cauſam non ſibi quoque pernicioſam futurum putant? Si affluentior rerum copia ſine ſcelere poſsideri non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit: quid illis, ſceleratius qui cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piditati violentiam &amp; avaritiae rapinas adjungunt. If riches bee ſo hurtfull, why doe they keepe ſuch adoe to become rich? and if wealth cannot bee poſſeſſed without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, what is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous than they, that have undone a King, a Church, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two whole Kingdomes, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelves?</hi> or are they ſo armed againſt the <hi>temptations of Mammon,</hi> that none of his <hi>Witchcrafts</hi> can hurt them? or if they may be ſo happy; why may not others as well as they?
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:43922:203"/>And if ſome of the Miniſtery have abuſed their riches, are there not others to bee found that have done much good with them? But have you never heard of ſome <hi>Clergy-Reform<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers,</hi> that heretofore cryed down <hi>Pluralities</hi> whilſt they could not get them themſelves?

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:43922:203"/>How were they ready to <hi>choak</hi> themſelves with <hi>Greedineſſe?</hi> ſwallowing down three or four Livings at one time.

            <p>The firſt is this; That <hi>the generall fountaine of all theſe our miſeries and caldmities, are the generall Corruptions, Backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings, and Pollutions that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us in this Nation.</hi>

            <p>It is eſtabliſhed upon three
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:43922:256"/>
               <hi>firme foundations:</hi> Firſt, upon <hi>Naturall Reaſon.</hi> Secondly, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>irrefragable evidence</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> Thirdly, upon <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, it is a principle writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon our hearts in the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which reacheth us that <hi>God being theſeſt couſe,</hi> as the <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of the Creatnres, ſo all their <hi>motions</hi> are <hi>dependant</hi> upon him, as they cannot be, ſo they cannot worke without him: All their motions are ſwayed and over-ruled by him, ſo that the creatures can give no helpe but by his commiſſion; they are all <hi>empty Channels,</hi> unleſſe they bee filled unto us by the <hi>ſtreames of his goodneſſe.</hi> If he
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:43922:257"/>give not the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>helpe</hi> and <hi>health</hi> unto them, all that they can doe will rather harme us than relieve us. <hi>His power and goodneſse is the ſinew and the ſtrength of them all:</hi> Therefore if God bee not preſent unto us in them with that, they will all prove but <hi>Broken Reedes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the Scripture is full of this Doctrine: there we find this principle acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the <hi>King of Iſrael,</hi> in the Diſcipline of the Famine whereby that Lecture was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on him as it ſeemes, 2 Kings 6.27. <hi>If the Lord doe not helpe thee, whence ſhall I helpe thee? out of the Barne floore, or out of the Wine-preſſe?</hi> But
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:43922:257"/>what he could not ſee perhaps but in the time of that <hi>actuall failing</hi> of the creature, The Spirit of God teacheth us to acknowledge in its <hi>greateſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and that <hi>what ever promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it makes, it can performe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, it is ſet downe in the generall rule, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.17. <hi>Every good gift, and every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gift is from above, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth downe from the Father of lights, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>bleſsings</hi> that are adminiſtred unto us by the Creatures, are but as ſo many <hi>rayes of light</hi> convayed unto us from that <hi>Father of lights</hi> by them; If hee intercept his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,</hi> they are nothing but <hi>darkneſſe and miſery:</hi> and if all
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:43922:258"/>
               <hi>good is from him,</hi> there can bee no <hi>good obtained without him.</hi> He is <hi>all-ſufficient</hi> without the <hi>creature,</hi> but they are altoget her <hi>inſufficient,</hi> yea <hi>deficient without God; without him all their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is dotage,</hi> all their <hi>plots</hi> and <hi>contrivances</hi> are <hi>madneſſe,</hi> all their <hi>ſtrength</hi> is <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> all their <hi>fidelity</hi> is <hi>treachery,</hi> and all their <hi>riches</hi> is extreame <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.</hi> Nay they are ſo far from being helps unto us, that they prove many times our greateſt impediments, like <hi>Sauls Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> unto <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 17.38, 39. <hi>Therefore God tells Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi> Judges 7.2. <hi>The people that are with thee are too many for mee to give the</hi> Midianites <hi>into their hands.</hi> And there you
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:43922:258"/>may ſee Gods reaſon too, <hi>leſt Iſrael vaunt themſelves againſt me ſaying, mine owne hand hath ſaved me.</hi> Obſerve Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the progreſſe of that ſtory, and profit by it, it may afford us excellent matter for our meditation.</p>
            <p>And ſee what is recorded concerning <hi>Vzziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.14, 15. <hi>Hee was marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly helped till hee was ſtrong: But when hee was ſtrong, his heart was lifted up to his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may ſtand and admire the working of this principle in another way upon our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King at this time, whilſt hee had Armies and much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtrength, he came downe;
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:43922:259"/>for indeed their wickedneſſe rendred them unworthy to bee a <hi>Guard</hi> for ſo <hi>pious a Prince,</hi> and much more to bee the <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of <hi>Gods mercy</hi> to him and to his people. But ſince he hath beene <hi>ſtripped</hi> of all thoſe <hi>outward helpes,</hi> how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hath <hi>God</hi> beene <hi>ſeene in the Mount?</hi> So that his Motto may be like that of Saint <hi>Paul, When I am weak then am I ſtrong.</hi> Inſomuch, that I muſt confeſse that I am almoſt <hi>afraid</hi> of his <hi>recruiting Armies,</hi> leſt by their <hi>irregular violences,</hi> and their <hi>former impieties,</hi> and <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,</hi> they prove to the <hi>interruption of the gracious work that God hath begunne for him, and his poore people. I beſeech
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:43922:259"/>God give them grace to beware of it. But I hope their former miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages will in struct them that they may not make themſelves guilty of a double ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This concluſion is yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed, Job 9.12, 13. <hi>Behold hee taketh away, who can hinder him, and who will ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, What doſt thou? If God will not withdraw his Anger, the proud helpers doe ſtoop under him.</hi>

            <p>The experiments are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable that Hiſtory affords to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>We need goe no farther than to thoſe evidences which have been given us in our late miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages.</p>

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:43922:263"/>in the mannaging thereof,</hi> and <hi>for want of engaging God</hi> with them in the work; yea through their <hi>diſ-ingaging of him by their wickedneſſe and horrid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties,</hi> they have beene <hi>defeated</hi> and <hi>brought to nothing. I pray God this may be remembred here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the other ſide,</hi> the <hi>Armies</hi> in which ſo many have truſted, and which they have beene at ſuch coſt to ſet up and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, inſtead of <hi>helping them,</hi> have become their <hi>Oppreſſours;</hi> the edge of their <hi>Swords</hi> hath been turned toward themſelves, and their own force threatneth them with ruine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Wealth</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Kingdome</hi> hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:43922:264"/>chaſed us no <hi>deliverance</hi> at all, but hath rather ſerved for the <hi>hire of our calamities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the <hi>Pillars</hi> on which we have leaned are <hi>broken,</hi> as it were, on all ſides; and we have no <hi>Foundation</hi> left us to reſt our ſelves upon, on earth.</p>
            <p>Oh then now let us learne from all this, that <hi>there is no helpe but in God.</hi> If <hi>wee have our recovery we muſt have it from heaven, and from his hand.</hi> No <hi>Drug</hi> will helpe us but <hi>Manus Chriſti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If wee ever have <hi>Peace</hi> we muſt have it from him. Hee is <hi>the Prince of peace,</hi> and <hi>the God of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the <hi>whole World</hi> ſhould conſpire to doe us good
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:43922:264"/>and to relieve us; yet if the <hi>Lord come not in</hi> to the worke it will be in vaine.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore learne <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> by our former <hi>follies,</hi> and doe not now relapſe into your old errours againe.</p>
            <p>There is much gaping af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter helpe from this and from that, from the <hi>Scots,</hi> and from the <hi>Welch,</hi> and from I know not whom; and indeed <hi>theſe may be instrumentall helpes,</hi> and it will be <hi>wonderfull in God to make them ſo.</hi> But <hi>all</hi> theſe <hi>will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, unleſſe God be brought in for us; unleſſe he be with us, as good they were all againſt us; They will neither prove faithfull unleſſe God hold them, nor helpfull unleſſe God ſtrengthen and proſper them.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="478" facs="tcp:43922:265"/>
            <p> Let us look upon them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the <hi>returning glimpſes of Gods mercy</hi> unto us, <hi>as his proffers</hi> and <hi>invitations, to make us ſeek unto him:</hi> But let us take heed that we <hi>place not our hope in them, nor in any creature.</hi> It is the common <hi>Dilemma</hi> of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane folly</hi> and <hi>perverſeneſſe,</hi> that <hi>where no outward help appeareth it is apt to deſpaire of help from God; and we will trust him no farther than we can ſee him in the meanes:</hi> but they that are of this mind, if they truely ſearch into their condition, will finde perhaps, that <hi>they truſt not in God, but in the meanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And againe, <hi>when outward help doth begin to ſhew it ſelfe, we are preſently too apt to forget our
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:43922:265"/>dependance upon God, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our expectations from him, and to ſet up that meanes for an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll in his Throne, by placing our hope and confidence therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I pray God deliver us from both theſe extreames; and teach us in all the varieties and changes of humane things to keepe our ſelves unmoveably fixed upon this Rocke; That our help commeth from the Lord which made heaven and earth.</hi> Pſal. 21.2.</p>
            <p>But it is a <hi>great queſtion</hi> that comes in the fourth place, and would require more ſpace than I have allowed mee to reſolve it fully. <hi>What courſe may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to engage</hi> God <hi>on our ſide, and to obtaine help and relief from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="480" facs="tcp:43922:266"/>
            <p> Firſt, let mee entreat you all to bee firmly fixed upon this, and to let it ſeize upon your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections as well as your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that <hi>if ever we be relieved it muſt be</hi> God <hi>that muſt relieve us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then take in this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for your direction:</p>
            <p>That <hi>there is no way to obtain help and deliverance from</hi> God, <hi>but by Humiliation, Repentance, and faithfull Prayer unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This onely will doe it, and this will doe it.</p>
            <p>I muſt divide, and be briefe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall premiſe only this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition: I deny not but God may grant outward deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; outward bleſſings where they are not ſought of him in
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:43922:266"/>this way, for divers ends that are knowne unto his heavenly wiſdome. He doth ſometimes take off judgements from the wicked, that he may render them ſo much the more <hi>unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable,</hi> and ſometimes to give them the reward of ſome <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Services,</hi> and ſometimes for the ſake of the righteous that live amongſt them; as God made an offer to <hi>Abraham</hi> of ſparing <hi>Sodom,</hi> if there had been <hi>Ten Righteous in the City:</hi> and ſometimes that by them he may <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>chaſtiſe his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi> ſometimes to make room for ſome greater Judgements, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.29. <hi>That the Serpents root may bring forth a Cockatrice;</hi> and ſometimes to <hi>leave men to
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:43922:267"/>themſelves,</hi> and <hi>to give them over as in a deſperate condition:</hi> as a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> withdrawes himſelf from the adminiſtration of <hi>Phyſick</hi> when hee findes the Diſeaſe invincible unto the meanes: So God ſpeakes of <hi>Iſrael, Iſa.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould you be ſtricken any more? ye will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt more and more.</hi> As the <hi>Husbandman</hi> gives over the <hi>Ploughing</hi> and the <hi>Harrowing</hi> of that ground that will not by all his Husbandry be <hi>reclaimed</hi> from <hi>barrenneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Weeds.</hi> And I beſeech <hi>God deliver us</hi> from ſuch a <hi>deliverance.</hi> We ought to pray unto God that he will not withdraw his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections from us untill he hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>one the work of Grace upon us.</p>
            <pb n="483" facs="tcp:43922:267"/>
            <p> But my meaning is this: Firſt, That we have no way to <hi>engage God</hi> unto deliverance, no way for us <hi>aſſuredly</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it at his hands, but by that Courſe that I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: And ſecondly, That God uſeth not to give a <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> and a <hi>comfortable delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> unto any but thoſe that ſeeke unto him in that way. It is a fearefull thing when <hi>God</hi> removes his <hi>Iudgements</hi> before we remove our <hi>Sins;</hi> when the caſe is with us as Reverend <hi>Gildas</hi> in his Epiſtle recordeth it of the <hi>Brittaines,</hi> not to their comfort but their terrour, <hi>A while ceaſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of our enemies, but yet not ceaſed the wickedneſſe of our
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:43922:268"/>Countrymen, our Foes leſt our People, but our People leſt not their Iniquities;</hi> and this was no good preſage, and I pray God it prove not our caſe. There is cauſe enough for us to tremble at the very thought of the <hi>departures of Calamities</hi> from us, <hi>if we conſider how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they have wrought upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to the purpoſe, Take it in theſe foure Branches.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is no obtaining of mercy and favour from God, which is the Fountaine of all our comfortable and true bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and deliverances, but by <hi>Humiliation</hi> for ſin paſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Repentance,</hi> or <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> from ſin unto God. Third-<hi>Prayer.</hi> And fourthly, <hi>Faith,</hi>
               <pb n="485" facs="tcp:43922:268"/>which muſt preſent them all unto <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all theſe in their effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy depend upon one another; No <hi>Converſion</hi> without <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,</hi> no <hi>Prayer</hi> without <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> no effectuall <hi>Prayer</hi> or <hi>Repentance</hi> without <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, no reconciling of God, nor obtaining of his favour and mercy, without humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſin paſt.</p>
            <p>See how God threatens the people of the Jewes for want of this, <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.10, 11, &amp;c. <hi>They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my Law, nor in my Statutes that I ſet before you, and before your Fathers;</hi> what followes? <hi>Therefore
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:43922:269"/>ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael, behold I will ſet my face againſt you for evill, and to cut off all Iudah, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12, 13. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places, where God layes the cauſe of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and encreaſe of his fury upon the want of this. And if we ſearch the whole Scripture, and the Hiſtory of <hi>Gods</hi> dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with the ſeverall people of the world, we ſhall never find that <hi>God</hi> was ever reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to any without this. And <hi>God</hi> is no Changeling, He is uniforme in his Actions, He is the ſame God ſtill as he was then, hates Sin as much now as ever he did, <hi>nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile him unto Sin;</hi> The Bloud
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:43922:269"/>of Chriſt could not reconcile him unto <hi>Sin,</hi> though it recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled him unto <hi>Sinners;</hi> and therefore as long as we are at peace with Sin, and at peace with our ſelves in Sin, there is no peace to be had with God: His anſwer will be to all our Petitions for peace like that Anſwer of <hi>Iehu</hi> unto <hi>Ioram,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.22. <hi>Is it peace Iehu?</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>And hee anſwered, What peace ſo long as the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of thy mother Iezabell and her witchcrafts are ſo many?</hi> Such hath the Anſwer of <hi>God</hi> beene a long time unto this Nation, and ſuch will it ever be untill we are humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand for our Sins. It is our <hi>peace</hi> that hinders our <hi>peace,</hi>
               <pb n="488" facs="tcp:43922:270"/>the dead and dull <hi>peace</hi> of our <hi>ſecurity,</hi> that hinders the <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>unity;</hi> our <hi>peace</hi> with our <hi>Sinnes</hi> hinders our <hi>peace</hi> with <hi>God;</hi> we have had indeed <hi>feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Humiliations, Iezebels Faſts,</hi> But we have not been exerciſed in true Humiliation and Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore we returne without a bleſſing; we have often indeed moved the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it were unto God, but he hath anſwered us as <hi>Iehu</hi> did him in a manner, in his <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> and <hi>operative</hi> word, in the continuance and encreaſe of our afflictions, <hi>What peace, as long as the Impieties, and Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of England are ſo many,</hi> and there is ſo little <hi>humiliation</hi> for them? It is the very proper
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:43922:270"/>and immediate end for which God ſends affliction, that hee may make Sin bitter unto us, that that bitterneſſe may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſanctified griefe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.19. and 4.18.</p>
            <p>Indeed there can be no peace with God without Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſin, becauſe without this can be no Repentance or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from Sin, for this is the <hi>Prologue</hi> and the <hi>Vſher</hi> unto <hi>Repentance.</hi> It is as it were the wombe, or rather the <hi>travell</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> of the ſoule whereby <hi>Repentance</hi> is <hi>brought forth.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>For godly ſorrow worketh Repentance to Salvation, not to be repented of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that no <hi>Humiliation,</hi> no <hi>Repentance</hi> or <hi>Converſion;</hi> for
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:43922:271"/>that I conceive the Apoſtle there meanes by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as he there differenceth it from <hi>godly ſorrow.</hi> It is the <hi>change of the heart</hi> which is <hi>Converſion:</hi> And as without <hi>Humiliation</hi> there is no <hi>Repentance,</hi> ſo without <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> or <hi>Converſion</hi> there is no <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to God, and ſo no <hi>mercifull,</hi> no <hi>true</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable deliverance</hi> to be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>That is the ſecond Theſis, or propoſition, That there is none to be had without Converſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sin</hi> in the foule is like <hi>Ionah</hi> in the Ship, untill the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prophet be caſt out, the ſtorme will not ceaſe: And unleſſe this Rebell of Sin be caſt out of the ſoule by a true
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:43922:271"/>and ſerious Converſion unto God, a forſaking of all our ſins, and cleaving unto God, the ſtormes of his fury and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation will be up againſt us, and if we heare them or feele them not, it is becauſe we are in a dead ſleep; yea, we are then many times in greateſt danger of them when we feele them leaſt. This tempeſt is oft moſt violent when it appeares a <hi>Calme,</hi> and it is a <hi>great affliction to be without affliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſhould I ſtand to prove this? The Scripture is every where almoſt embroyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with this Doctrine; take a place or two for the preſent.</p>
            <p>See how God threatens not only the continuance, but the
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:43922:272"/>multiplication of Judgements upon <hi>Iſrael? Amos</hi> 4. What a <hi>Chaine</hi> of calamities he makes for them, and what a heavy <hi>weight</hi> of judgement hee han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth at the end of it, from the 6. unto the 13. verſe, <hi>I have given you cleanneſſe of teeth in all your Cities, and want of bread in all your places, yet have you not returned unto me ſaith the Lord.</hi> &amp;c? There the Lord deales with them as they uſe to do with unruly Priſoners, hangs firſt the <hi>Irons of one affliction upon them,</hi> and when thoſe will not tame them, then he hangs more and more upon them, and if none will do, at laſt he brings them to execution; So there he ſent
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:43922:272"/>
               <hi>Famine</hi> upon them, to make them <hi>return,</hi> but they would not <hi>turne:</hi> Then he ſends <hi>Drowth</hi> after the <hi>Famine,</hi> and <hi>Blaſting</hi> and <hi>Mildew</hi> and the <hi>Palmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme</hi> after the <hi>Drowth,</hi> and the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> after theſe, and the <hi>Sword</hi> with the <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> and the <hi>Fire</hi> after the <hi>Sword,</hi> as ſo many Meſſengers one after another, to fetch home thoſe Prodigalls to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe; but when none of theſe will doe, he threatens them with a Judgement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a name as it were, <hi>Therefore thus will I do unto thee O Iſrael: and becauſe I will doe thus unto thee prepare to meet thy God O Iſrael.</hi> If you have a deſire to know what this Judgement is,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:43922:273"/>I conceive you may find it in the next chapter, there the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is ſinging as it were the <hi>Dirge,</hi> and <hi>celebrating</hi> the <hi>ſad funerall of Iſrael, Chap.</hi> 9.1, 2. <hi>Heare ye this word which I take up againſt you, even a Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, oh houſe of Iſrael. The virgin of Iſrael is fallen, ſhe ſhall no more ariſe, ſhe is forſaken upon her Land, there is none to raiſe her up:</hi> Let this impenitent and ſecure Nation of ours reade this and tremble; And let them reade what the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.12. <hi>If a man will not turne he will whet his ſword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what a Commentary our bleſſed Saviour makes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſlaughter of the <hi>Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and of thoſe upon whom
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:43922:273"/>the <hi>Tower</hi> in <hi>Siloam</hi> fell, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. and the ſame gloſſe will hold upon all thoſe ſad Rubricks of Bloud and ruine that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen others before us in this Nation; and upon all other black and mournfull ſtories of Gods Judgements that are recorded of our owne people or others. The <hi>waters</hi> of the <hi>old world;</hi> The <hi>fire of Sodom and Gomorrah;</hi> The <hi>deſolations of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> The <hi>ruines of Babylon;</hi> The <hi>late devaſtations of poore Germany,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> And the <hi>deſtructions that have</hi> befallen ſo many thouſands <hi>in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> They all ſeeme to cry out unto us in that voice of our Saviour there, <hi>Except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh:</hi>
               <pb n="496" facs="tcp:43922:274"/>Ye ſhall all periſh as well as they, though perhaps not in the ſame manner; if ye eſcape affliction here, ye ſhall be paid to the full with all arreares and intereſt in eternall damnation hereafter.</p>
            <p>It is the <hi>method of mercy,</hi> firſt to <hi>remove ſin,</hi> and then to <hi>remove judgement:</hi> Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is put before healing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Leſt they ſee with their eyes, and heare with their cares, and underſtand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</hi> Obſerve the order, firſt there is <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, then Converſion, then healing of affliction. Ier.</hi> 30.17. <hi>I will reſtore health unto thee, and I will heale thee of thy wounds.</hi> Firſt, <hi>health from ſin, and then
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:43922:274"/>health from affliction.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.22. and 57.18, 19, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>God muſt needs hate us, as long as we are in love with ſin.</p>
            <p>An impenitent and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted heart is ſhut out from Gods favour, and from his mercy; It muſt needs be ſo, for he is <hi>ſhut out from Prayer: Prayer</hi> is the <hi>Key</hi> wherewith God hath appointed us <hi>to open the treaſures of mercy</hi> unto us. Now as there is no <hi>Repentance</hi> or <hi>Converſion from ſin without Humiliation for ſin:</hi> So there is <hi>no Prayer,</hi> I meane <hi>no accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prayer without Repentance.</hi> We are ſo far from any aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of receiving, that God doth not admit us to be Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:43922:275"/>without it. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11. 12, 13, 15, 16. <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.8. <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the wicked is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord: but the prayer of the upright is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: Prov.</hi> 15.8. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not heare me.</hi> It is in vaine for us to cry unto God as long as we continue in our ſins, and at enmity with God; that blaſts all our Petitions, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30.15. <hi>Why cryeſt thou for thine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</hi> (ſaith God to Iſrael) <hi>Thy ſorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquities, becauſe thy ſins were increaſed I have done theſe things unto thee,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two muſt indeed help forwards one another, we muſt
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:43922:275"/>
               <hi>Repent, that we may pray,</hi> and we muſt <hi>Pray, that we may Repent.</hi> As our <hi>body warmes our cloaths,</hi> and our <hi>cloaths preſerve</hi> the heate of our <hi>bodies;</hi> If there were no warmth in our bodies, our cloaths would not warme us; Cloathe a cold Carkaſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much, it will not make it warme: ſo unleſſe we repent, Prayer will doe us no good. Now Prayer is the meanes that God hath ordained for us to obtaine help at his hand by, <hi>Aske and it ſhall be given you, ſeeke and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you: Mat.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me. Pſal.</hi> 50 15. If we will not aske deliverance
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:43922:276"/>we are like to go without it; All our <hi>fighting</hi> and <hi>warring</hi> will do no good: <hi>Iames</hi> 4.2. <hi>Ye lust and have not, ye kill and deſire to have, and cannot obtaine, ye fight and warre, yet ye have not, becauſe ye aske not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayer</hi> is the <hi>Bucket of the Soule</hi> whereby wee are to draw water out of the wells of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; the <hi>Chaine</hi> whereby we are to <hi>bind God,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to have done, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10. <hi>Let me alone</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>that my wrath may waxe hot againſt them, and that I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them in a moment;</hi> As if <hi>God</hi> could not <hi>conſume</hi> if <hi>Moſes</hi> would <hi>Pray.</hi> Theſe are the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt weapons againſt our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; <hi>Ioſhua</hi> cannot prevaile
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:43922:276"/>in the Field, unleſſe <hi>Moſes</hi> hands be lift up upon the Mount. Theſe are the <hi>Armes</hi> and <hi>Sinewes</hi> of a Chriſtian, whereby he is to wreſtle with God like <hi>Iacob,</hi> and to wreſt the bleſſing out of his hands; <hi>Haec vis Deo grata est,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> God loves to be thus overcome by his People; This is the <hi>Mathooke</hi> whereby we muſt digge into the Golden Mines of Gods bleſſings; we muſt aske if we meane to have.</p>
            <p>But it muſt be a right Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a <hi>faithfull Prayer; nothing acceptable to God without Faith;</hi> Neither <hi>Contrition,</hi> nor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> not <hi>Supplication,</hi> can be prevalent, unleſſe they be all <hi>offered</hi> up, and <hi>preſented by faith;
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:43922:277"/>Without faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God, Heb.</hi> 11.6. See the excellent ſcale of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13, 14. Firſt he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Prayer at the very top of bleſſing, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But then marke how Prayer gets up, how it climes unto Gods Treaſury, <hi>How ſhall they call on him on whom they have not beleeved? and how ſhall they beleeve on him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they heare without a Preacher? and how ſhall they preach except they be ſent? Faith</hi> is the <hi>Ladder of Iacob,</hi> or rather <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Ladder,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> whereby the <hi>Angels</hi> of our <hi>Prayers</hi> get up unto <hi>God,</hi>
               <pb n="503" facs="tcp:43922:277"/>and procure the <hi>Angels</hi> of his <hi>bleſsings</hi> to deſcend down again <hi>upon us;</hi> As Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> ſo we may ſay of every bleſſing: of <hi>peace,</hi> of <hi>deliverance,</hi> of <hi>all: If any man lacke them, let him aske of God, who giveth unto all men liberally, and upbraydeth not, and they ſhall be given him,</hi> to wit as farre as it is a gift: as farre <hi>as</hi> it <hi>is fit</hi> and <hi>convenient for Gods glory,</hi> for <hi>the good of the Church,</hi> and <hi>for his owne good.</hi> But then marke, <hi>Let him aske in faith nothing wavering, for he that wavereth is like a wave of the Sea, driven with the wind and toſſed:</hi> As the <hi>wave</hi> is lifted up toward heaven but falleth down again preſently without
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:43922:278"/>attaining unto it, ſo is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a man towards God in Prayer without faith. <hi>Let not that man thinke that he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive anything of the Lord,</hi> that is to ſay, he can promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe nothing by ſuch a Prayer. Note every thinking to obtain by Prayer is not Faith, there is a confidence which is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent preſumption, that is not it. That we miſtake not, note the <hi>Acts</hi> of Faith and its <hi>Object,</hi> and its <hi>ground; Firſt,</hi> we muſt beleeve that <hi>God is,</hi> an Atheiſt cannot pray. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we muſt beleeve <hi>that God is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeeke him,</hi> an Epicure cannot pray. To this latter it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>first to beleeve Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
               <pb n="505" facs="tcp:43922:278"/>that he knows our wants. Secondly, <hi>His power,</hi> that he is able to relieve us. But many there be that are wiſe enough, and able enough, that have no good will; Therefore we muſt in the third place beleeve that <hi>God hath a good will towards us to do it.</hi> But how can we beleeve that, when we are all in our ſelves ſinners, and his enemies, have nothing in us to engage his love or his good will, but are full of provocations to his wrath? It is neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the fourth place that <hi>Faith lay hold upon the reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation betweene God and us in Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> we muſt therefore beleeve <hi>that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for our ſins, and juſtified us by his
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:43922:279"/>obedience;</hi> And that God hath opened unto us his <hi>Exchequer,</hi> his <hi>Office of mercy in Chriſt;</hi> that <hi>he hath given Chriſt to dye for us,</hi> and <hi>doth accept us in Christ,</hi> and <hi>for Chriſts death and righteouſneſſe ſake;</hi> and that we <hi>being accepted,</hi> and <hi>reconciled by Chriſt, our Services, our Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, our Prayers, our Prayſes,</hi> and all, <hi>are accepted in and for him,</hi> as <hi>God accepted Abell</hi> and <hi>his Offering. The ground</hi> of all this is <hi>Gods truth in his promiſe, in the Scriptures:</hi> we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>this to be Gods Word,</hi> and that offers it ſelfe unto our faith in a multitude of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; In the <hi>Prophecies fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> In the <hi>ſpirituality and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the doctrin,</hi> In the <hi>perfection
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:43922:279"/>thereof for all perſons, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and caſes;</hi> In the <hi>weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> whereby the work is declared not to be of them, but of God: For <hi>as is the man ſo is his ſtrength;</hi> no Agent can work above its faculty; ſimple men could not poſſibly of their owne ſtore produce ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull wiſdome; they could <hi>not</hi> have that wiſdome <hi>from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than;</hi> the wiſdome is too pure, and they were too holy, and too honeſt; therefore either from <hi>good Angels,</hi> or from <hi>God:</hi> If from <hi>good Angels,</hi> they muſt needs have it from <hi>God,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they were falſe in preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it as his, &amp; then they ſhould not be <hi>Angels</hi> but <hi>Devils;</hi> if
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:43922:280"/>muſt therefore be from God, and then it will follow that it muſt be immediately from God by inſpiration and illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit, at leaſt in the greateſt part of it, (though ſome were by the miniſtration of Angels, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2.) Becauſe it witneſſeth ſo of it ſelfe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the <hi>wonderfull unity &amp; agreement of ſo various and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Authors in ſeverall times and places,</hi> and by the <hi>very ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing differences,</hi> which will ſhew it to be <hi>no packt &amp; contrived uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> By the <hi>impartiality of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> &amp; the <hi>different waies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from the impoſtures of humane policy,</hi> ſetting down the groſſe ſlips and fals of the eminenteſt
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:43922:280"/>inſtruments and profeſſors of that truth, which humane poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy would never have done; by the very <hi>height and myſteriouſnes of the Doctrine. Tertull de Carn. Chriſt. Credibile eſt, quia ineptum eſt, certu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt, qui a impoſsibile eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe and many other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, faith is engaged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it to be Gods word, and then the promiſes to be his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, we muſt then neceſſarily believe them to be <hi>true;</hi> for <hi>truth is a perfection, which the perfecteſt being which is God cannot want.</hi> So then <hi>Faith must beleeve the Promiſes.</hi> The <hi>ſumme of all is in Chriſt,</hi> for <hi>all the Promiſes of God are yea and amen in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faith layes hold firſt upon the <hi>Promiſes of Chriſt,</hi> that we
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:43922:281"/>are <hi>reconciled unto God by Chriſt,</hi> and ſo <hi>have acceſſe to him,</hi> &amp; that <hi>his eare is at our command</hi> (be it ſpoken with reverence) <hi>in Chriſt;</hi> and that though <hi>we</hi> are <hi>Sinners,</hi> yet <hi>he</hi> is <hi>our Advocate, and the Propitiation for our ſins,</hi> Faith firſt muſt lay hold upon Chriſt, fly to Chriſt, ſeize upon Chriſt by adherence, and rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our ſelves upon him for our peace with God and Salvation, embracing him and his merits and righteouſneſſe, as the only and the ſure meanes thereof; And then we may and muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that God is ready to do all things for us, that we ſhall aske of him in the name, and by the Mediation of Chriſt, building upon that Promiſe of
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:43922:281"/>Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.23. And that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his owne Son, but gave him up to dye for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> This we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve God is willing to do for Chriſts ſake for us, ſeeking it of him in Chriſt, in <hi>his good time,</hi> and in ſuch <hi>meaſure</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> as ſhall be <hi>beſt pleaſing to him, and moſt for his glory, the true good of the whole Body of the Church, and the true good of that member that asketh of him:</hi> Not that we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that we ſhall receive eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular thing that wee aske of God, for God doth ſometimes <hi>deny out of mercy,</hi> (Though we ſhould keep our
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:43922:282"/>ſelves as cloſe as we can unto the Promiſe in our Prayers, and then we may be ſure to ſpeed well) But <hi>That God doth lend a gracious eare to our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> we comming to him in Chriſt, and by Chriſt (wee muſt looke to that;) And <hi>that he will give ſuch returnes unto them as he ſhall know to be beſt.</hi> Much more might be ſaid, and profitably ſaid too in this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; But if it pleaſe God I may have another occaſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon theſe. This is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient I hope here to ſhew the neceſſity of Faith to make Prayer and all duties accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God. He that comes <hi>without faith</hi> comes <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> and then he is not like
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:43922:282"/>to ſpeed: for as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſaid to his Brethren concerning <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> ſo God unto us, <hi>Except we bring Chriſt Ieſus with us, we ſhall not ſee his face.</hi> He is the great <hi>Maſter of requeſts,</hi> from whoſe hand God receives all our Petitions; He is our <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate;</hi> He is our <hi>high Prieſt</hi> by whom we are to offer up all our <hi>ſpirituall Sacrifices,</hi> the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of a broken ſpirit in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, Pſalm.</hi> 51.17. <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of righteouſneſſe in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> from the wayes of ſinne to the waies of righteouſneſſe, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 4.5.

               <hi>Sacrifices, that propitiateth God to us and them all,</hi> and his <hi>merit</hi> is the <hi>Incenſe</hi> that perfumeth our <hi>Prayers</hi> and all other <hi>our Offerings.</hi> See <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.3. and therefore it muſt be faithfull Prayer.</p>
            <p>But I have done with this Point, only give me leave now to preſent my hearty and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble requeſt unto all the people of theſe diſtreſſed Nations, that they will now at length leave doting upon <hi>things that cannot help,</hi> and depend no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon earthly and tranſitory aides, after ſo many miſcaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our <hi>carnall confidence,</hi> whereby God hath knockt our fingers, as it were, to make us loſe our holt from thoſe <hi>falſe
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:43922:283"/>dependances,</hi> and that they will now betake themſelves ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earneſtly unto God. By theſe waies which are here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. I forbid you not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth God forbid, but doth both permit and require that that you ſhould make uſe of all honeſt and lawfull outward ſuccours, which he in his good providence ſhall adminiſter unto us, for God will not have us to be <hi>idle beggars;</hi> And it is a good rule that I have read ſomewhere, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>David</hi> muſt <hi>go forth with his Army againſt the Philiſtines at the hearing of the ſound of going in the tops of the Mulbery trees;</hi> Though that were the ſigne that God gave
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:43922:284"/>him of his <hi>going before him to ſmite them,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.15. It is the <hi>honour</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do us, to make us <hi>ſerve</hi> him with our endeavours in the gracious workes of his mercies towards us.

The devill knew this well enough it is like, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was perhaps that he mangled that verſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the temptation of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.6. God in the barren wilderneſſe made the <hi>Clouds</hi> the <hi>barne</hi> or <hi>granary</hi> of the people as it were, and ſent them <hi>Manna</hi> from heaven, and turned the <hi>Rocke</hi> into a <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> in that dry and thirſty Land: But when they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <hi>quickly</hi> leſt it be <hi>too late;</hi> away with procraſtinations, <hi>Illud mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dò &amp; modò non habet modum;</hi> There is no end of our <hi>anons,</hi> &amp; <hi>too morrowes,</hi> if we yeeld unto our Tempter, and our corrupt hearts. <hi>Seeke the Lord whilſt he may be found, call upon him whilſt he is neere.

            </p>
            <p>But eſpecially let me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeake you, my <hi>beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> and <hi>fellow ſufferers,</hi> unto whom I deſire to empty out my ſoule in this Exhortation. You that are the <hi>Loyall people</hi>

Oh <hi>deſpiſe not the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Lord, nor caſt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes behind your back; deceive not your ſelves with vaine hopes; Truſt not to the righteouſneſſe of your cauſe:</hi> Alas have we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſo ſoone how <hi>our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe hath betrayed it once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready? And Sin is as great a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour ſtill as ever.

               <hi>how many Achans are there amongſt us!</hi> we may even trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thinke on it.

            <pb n="530" facs="tcp:43922:292"/>
            <p> Let us have <hi>no more of your ſwiniſh Drunkennes,</hi> nor <hi>your ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otous revellings,</hi> nor <hi>your brutiſh Luſts.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do not thinke you can do any thing without God: leave him out of he buſineſſe no more.</hi>

            <p>There remaineth yet one thing to make my building an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to my platforme, to ſpeake ſome few words of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for the right perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe workes, and I have done, they muſt be but a few, the Lord ſupply what ſhall be wanting.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In generall to all.</p>

            <p>Let us take the ſurvey of our former <hi>thoughts,</hi> of our <hi>Words,</hi> and of our <hi>Actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> of the <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,</hi> and <hi>aggravations</hi> of our <hi>ſins,</hi> of our <hi>omiſsions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions,</hi> and <hi>repetitions</hi> of the ſame ſins.</p>
            <p>Of our <hi>failings</hi> in the <hi>end</hi> of our obedience, in not ayming at <hi>Gods glory</hi> in our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, but rather ſacrificing to our <hi>owne glory,</hi> and to our <hi>worldly and wicked purpoſes,</hi> which hath polluted our beſt Actions.</p>
            <p>Of our <hi>failing in the rule of obedience.</hi>

            <pb n="537" facs="tcp:43922:295"/>
            <p> In the <hi>matter,</hi> and in the <hi>manner,</hi> and in the <hi>meaſure,</hi> &amp;c. Let us examine our ſelves, and judge our ſelves, <hi>not by the customes of the world, nor by the opinions of men, nor by the humours of the times,</hi> nor by the <hi>corrupt imaginations and partiall affections of our own hearts:</hi> But ſetting our ſelves before the <hi>tribunall,</hi> and at the <hi>Barre</hi> of our <hi>Conſciences,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>tribunall of God;</hi> Let us ſift our ſelves <hi>by the Law of God,</hi> and conſider wherein we have failed, either in matter of <hi>piety towards God,</hi> or in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>charity to one another,</hi> or in matter of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Chastity,</hi> in our ſelves; <hi>Trying</hi> our ſoules, and

            </p>
            <p>And when we have <hi>found out</hi> our ſins, let us <hi>condemne</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> our ſelves for them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging them unto God with <hi>compunction</hi> of Spirit, conſidering <hi>what a glorious and powerfull, and what a gratious and mercifull God we have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: What a tender Saviour we have diſhonoured; what a holy Law we have tranſgreſſed; what precious ſoules we have endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; what a glorious inheritance we have forfeited; what horrour of hell and eternall damnation we have deſerved; what reproach we have brought upon the name

            </p>
            <pb n="540" facs="tcp:43922:297"/>
            <p> Fourthly, Let us ſet our ſelves upon the <hi>diligent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable uſe of the meanes of grace,</hi> in <hi>reading the Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>meditating</hi> frequently on them; <hi>Hearing the word</hi> with reverence and godly feare; &amp; examining all our thoughts, words, and actions thereby, keeping this reſolution as an unreverſible fixed Law in our hearts, <hi>not to allow our ſelves in any thing that is diſpleaſing to God, though it bring never ſo much pleaſure, or profit, or ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honour with it;</hi> withall we muſt exerciſe our ſelves in the pious and frequent receiving of the Sacrament, the neglect whereof, as it may be well ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to be one of the great

            <p>Fifthly, we muſt apply our ſelves to ſome honeſt buſineſſe, and ſome good employments, (<hi>Idleneſſe</hi> being <hi>the</hi> great <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger of ſin, the devill being like a great and exacting Lord of a mannour, laying claime to all the woſte,</hi>) and to a <hi>Chriſtian watchfulneſſe</hi> over our ſelves, prudently <hi>avoyding the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſin,</hi> and endeavouring to <hi>foreſee, and provide againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi> It would be very help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full I conceive, <hi>every Evening

               </gap>; <hi>Where I have been? What I have done? What duties I ſhould have done that day and have omitted.</hi> And ſeeking pardon and grace for the future, and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves againſt our ſins with holy reſolutions. And if every morning we would <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:43922:298"/>our ſelves what temptations we may fall into that day,</hi> and if we can, contrive prudently the avoydance of them: if not, to <hi>deſire Gods helpe, and the grace of his Spirit to arme us againſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, It will behove us to <hi>bend our ſelves moſt againſt thoſe ſinnes unto which we are moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and againſt our master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, To <hi>be wary of our Society,</hi> and as much as we may to <hi>avoid evill Company, and to aſſociate our ſelves with thoſe that are good; evill communication corrupts good manners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, To <hi>meditate often of the preſence of God,</hi> who is with us every where, ſeeing all
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:43922:299"/>our moſt ſecret thoughts, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our moſt whiſpering words, and obſerving all our moſt private actions, See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. and meditate upon it. To contemplate of the <hi>houre of death, the frailty of life, the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the world, the profitableneſſe of righteouſneſſe, having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of this life, and that which is to come; of the all-ſufficiency of God and Chriſt, of the day of Iudgement, of the joyes of heaven, and the paines of hell; of eternity, and above all, of Gods love toward us in Chriſt Ieſus: of his Paſsion, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion; of his Kingdome, Prieſthood, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> and of the <hi>glorious patternes of his holy life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>Be frequent and
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:43922:299"/>fervent in Suppplications to God for the King, and his Family, the Church, the Kingdoms,</hi> for the obtaining of a <hi>remedy to our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and deſolations, with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion to his Will, and regard unto his glory.</hi> And let all be offered up with a firme faith in Chriſt Jeſus, reſting upon Gods mercy toward us in him.</p>
            <p>For a <hi>helpe unto theſe Duties,</hi> I do not undertake to preſcribe any thing in this kind in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; but if I might without offence <hi>give my advice, I would adviſe all good Chriſtians that wiſh well to the King, &amp; Church, and Kingdom, to give themſelves to a private weekly Faſt, once a weeke at the leaſt during theſe
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:43922:300"/>miſeries, to be employed in earnest Supplication to God for pardon of the ſins, and the removall of his judgements, from the King, and his people, and theſe Nations,</hi> and for the obtaining <hi>of grace and holineſſe,</hi> and in other holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, agreeable thereunto.</p>
            <p>Now for the Loyall Party in particular, I have only thus much to ſay.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To intreat them to get <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, pious, &amp; able Miniſters</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, that may inſtruct them, and guide them in the waies of God, and aſſiſt them with prayer and Supplication.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they make it their <hi>principall care to ſet up Religion in their Camps,</hi> and to keep up a <hi>pious diſcipline amongſt the

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43922:308"/>by us as incitements and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to ſinne, and upon the very ground and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy moſt incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible goodneſſe towards us, we have built up the Babell of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, the curſed building of diſobedience and impiety a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee; yea O Lord there are too too many of us that have trodden under foot the Son of God, &amp; have counted the bloud of the Covenant wherewith we have been ſanctified an unholy thing; and have done deſpite unto the Spirit of grace, whileſt they have made a mock of Religion and Piety; to the great diſheartning of the work of thy ſervice; the horrible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of thy Majeſtie; to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43922:308"/>deplorable ſcandall of our Chriſtian profeſſion; and to the almoſt (O Lord that it might be no more) inevitable ruine and damnation of their owne ſoules.</p>
            <p>Thus, thus, O Lord our God have we requited thee for all thy goodneſſe and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; and the more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thou haſt ſhewed thy ſelf unto us, the more wicked and ſinfull have wee beene againſt thee.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt made us a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and fruitfull Land, even as the Land of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> which was as the Garden of God; And we have (it may be feared) outdone the ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah:</hi> their ſins
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43922:309"/>were pride and idleneſſe, and fulneſſe of bread, together with horrid and unnaturall luſts; and which of theſe ſins have not beene committed in our Land? Yea many more ſinnes not inferiour unto theſe have ſent up their cry unto heaven againſt us: and it is the wonder of thy mercy and forbearance that thou haſt not long ere this ſent down fire from heaven upon us to have conſumed our whole Nation into aſhes; we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted deeper of the Cup of thy mercies then Iſrael, and yet the meaſure of our ſins (as we may juſtly feare) hath been no way leſſe then the ſins of unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iſrael; yea we have juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:43922:309"/>by our iniquities, and therefore it were moſt juſt in thee to give us up to deſolation as thou haſt done them.</p>
            <p>But O Lord our God, thou haſt not ſo left us off: when thy mercies would not worke upon us, thou haſt aſſayed us with thy bitter chaſtiſements and corrections, that thou mighteſt thereby have whipped us from our ſins; when Cordials and pleaſant medicines would not heale us, thou haſt uſed the bitter pills, and irkeſome purgatives of calamities and afflictions; thou haſt applied the launce unto our ſwelling ſores, by ſuffering thy wrath to grow hot againſt us in great and many miſeries that thou

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43922:310"/>ſuch unthankefull wretches, that thou mighteſt have cured the diſeaſes that we had contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by our fulneſſe, by the contrary medicines of ſcarcity and want; and ſo have reduced us to an healthfull temper of humility and obedience unto thee: proclaiming thereby as it were a generall and neceſſary faſt unto us in the houſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that we might have made a vertue of that neceſſity in the exerciſe of repentance; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thou haſt afrighted and amazed us with prodigies in the Creatures, by wonderfull and unwonted changes in the ſeverall parts and operations of the univerſe, by rare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall Comets in the heavens,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43922:311"/>and in the aire, by fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſent upon our Churches and dwellings; thou haſt ſhot thy thunderbolts and haile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones againſt us; the earth hath trembled and quaked under us, as not being able to beare the weight and burden of our ſins; and the waters have broken forth upon us by ſudden delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to our deſtruction, to mind us of our great pollutions wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our iniquities have over ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed againſt thee; yea they have altered their courſes in their ebbings and flowings, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us of our unnaturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in our ſinnes; and when none of theſe things would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, thou haſt drawn out the Sword of our neighbour nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt us; and becauſe that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43922:311"/>would not worke upon us, thou haſt now for a long time put the ſpirit of frenzy and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into our hearts, and armed us with ſury againſt our ſelves, making us to become the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of thy juſt wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our owne Nation, by ſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing our ſwords in our owne bowels; thou haſt divided us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, &amp; daſhtus in peeces one againſt another, that by our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with one another thou mightſt have ſcourged us to the embracement of peace &amp; recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with thee; thou haſt put out the glory of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and caſt our Crowne downe to the ground; thou haſt raiſed up a rebellion amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt thine annointed, and

               <p>O Moſt glorious and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord God, who ruleſt and governeſt all things; Thine are all the Kingdomes of the world, and all the Nations of the earth are in thy power and at thy diſpoſing: Thou buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt them that they may ſtand, and thou planteſt them that they may grow, and whilſt thou watereſt them they flouriſh, and at the blaſt of the breath of thy diſpleaſure they fade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and come to nothing; whilſt thou bleſſeſt them they are bleſſed, when thou curſeſt them they are weake and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43922:332"/>Looke down, I beſeech thee, upon theſe poore Nations that lye weltring before thee in their bloud, &amp; in their ſins; that are entangled in the net, and perplexed in the Labyrinth of their great tranſgreſſions and miſeries, and cannot tell how to get out. O Lord our God, I beſeech thee take pity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and grant us a releaſe; Thou haſt the ſoveraigne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines with thee that can heale both our ſins and miſeries, we are unworthy of thy mercy, but thou art a God that deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in mercy, and the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved it is, the greater is thy glory; nothing is too hard for thee, no malady ſo deſperate, no ſickneſſe ſo incurable, as to outbid either thy wiſdome or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43922:332"/>goodneſſe; they are both glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but neither can be puzzled or hindered by the extremities of our conditions. It is thy property, and thy divine peculiar worke to helpe when there is no help to be found; wo have been ſtruggling, and ſtriving, O Lord, a long time to get out of the toyle of our afflictions, but all in vain; The more we ſtrive the farther ſtill we are engaged in the miſchief; whereſoever we run thine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſtick faſt in us, &amp; the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon therof drinketh up our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; thy terrors ſet themſelves in array againſt us; all our hopes in the Creatures have deceived us, They have proved unto us but falſe conceptions;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43922:333"/>they have brought forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wind; we have waited for help but we have found none. And therefore now O Lord we come to thee, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee our God to have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon us, that what all the ſtrength in the world cannot worke for us, nor all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the world contrive for us, we may yet obtaine from thee our God.</p>
               <p>But alas how ſhould we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any thing at thy hands, when there are ſuch loud cries and clamours of our great and horrid ſinnes and iniquities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us?</p>
               <p>How ſhouldſt thou draw neere unto us that do continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally run away from thee, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43922:333"/>flye from thy mercy by our impenitency and wickedneſſe, even whilſt we aske mercy at thy hands?</p>
               <p>How ſhouldeſt thou but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre and abominate us, that by our filthy and noy ſome ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities have made our whole Land even to ſtinke in thy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrills? O Lord our God we confeſſe there is nothing in us that can challenge thy favour, or beſpeake any reliefe from thee;</p>
               <p>If it be thy pleaſure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us, to conſume us with all thy plagues, and damne us all, even our whole Nation, to the bottomleſſe pit of hell, we have nothing to reply or object againſt thee; it is no
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43922:334"/>more than our iniquities call for: But we beſeech thee O Lord to be gracious unto us; all that we can do is to beg it at thy hands, to beſeech thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, to implore thy compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to plead unto thee thy gracious Promiſes in Chriſt, and the Merits of thy Sonne, whereby thou haſt engaged thy ſelfe that what we aske in his Name we ſhall receive. Thou haſt opened unto us a gate of mercy in him, he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Pardon for us with his owne Bloud; He is the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world; and thou haſt opened in him a fountaine of Grace to ſanctifie our natures, and reforme our ſins. That the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43922:334"/>clouds may be removed, and thy light and grace may ſhine upon us; We deſire therefore to relinquiſh our ſelves, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime our ſelves, and to come unto thee in and by Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, beſeeching thee for his ſake to ſave our poore ſinfull Nations; O deale not with us after our iniquities, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the greatneſſe of thy mercy thinke thou upon us, O Lord for thy goodnes. O Lord forgive our great and horrid offences that have provoked thy wrath againſt us.</p>

               <p>O Lord thou righteous Judge of heaven and earth, who haſt committed all power unto thy Son Chriſt Jeſus both in heaven and earth, and haſt revived the rayes of his ſupreame Authority and Majeſtie unto Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whom thou haſt ordained to be the Rulers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of thy people, to the end that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and honeſty.</p>

Conſider his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies how many they are, and what a tyrannous hatred they beare againſt him. Conſider O Lord how low they have brought him; what great bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and affliction they have laid upon him; how they have impriſoned his Perſon, robbed him of his revenue, killed and maſſacred his Loyall and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full People, bereaved him of the comforts of his Queene, and Children, left him deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the ſolace of his friends, abridged him of the attendance

            <p>As for us, O Lord, make us patiently to endure what thy fatherly hand ſhall be pleaſed to inflict upon us, whether by them or by any other meanes, and give us alwayes a readineſſe of heart to forgive all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries that they have done unto us, and to embrace an hearty reconciliation with them, whenſoever they ſhall be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by thy grace to give over their unjuſt cruelties againſt us: and Lord lay not thoſe ſins unto their charge. Grant this O Lord for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
